AB  - It is widely accepted that mechanical injury to spinal cord can cause nervous system dysfunction, which leads to the loss of movement and sensation. However, the exact molecular mechanism is currently unclear. In this study, contused rat spinal cords were collected at 8 h, 1 day, 3, and 5 days after injury and the expression patterns of the proteins were monitored and quantified with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis-based proteomics. Fifty-one protein spots showed significant regulation at least at one time point. Of the 39 proteins, identified by mass spectrometry analysis and clustered into three down-regulation profiles and two up-regulation profiles, eight contusion-related proteins have been reported in previous proteomic studies of spinal cord whereas 31 proteins were described for the first time. For example, apoptosis-related protein of heat shock 70 kDa protein 1B increased after contusion, reaching the peak at 1 day; septin 7, a protein involved in cytoskeleton organization, maintained a steady increase for the first 5 days after injury; metabolism-related protein of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A synthase 1 was constantly down-regulated during the whole time course observed; tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, epsilon polypeptide, associated with cell cycle progression, showed a gradual increase after contusion. To our knowledge, this is the first case of detailed and dynamic proteomic snapshots of contusion-induced spinal cord injury. Most of the identified proteins were found for the first time to be differentially expressed after spinal cord contusion, which may help explore the complex molecular cascades underlying the progressive pathologic changes in the contused spinal cord.

AB  - This study investigated the proteomic changes at different time points in the precipitated pellets of rat spinal cords after applying complete spinal cord transection. By two-dimensional electrophoresis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, MALDI-TOF/TOF and peptide mass fingerprinting analysis, 44 proteins were identified, most of which are membrane and/or organellar proteins. They are mainly involved in metabolic processes (75%), developmental processes (30%), or responses to stimuli (30%), playing negative or positive roles. In particular, decreases of pyruvate dehydrogenase beta, aconitase 2, fumarate hydratase 1, and ATP synthase subunit 6 can lead to ATP depletion by crippling tricarboxylic acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Decreases of several antioxidant proteins such as catalase, peroxiredoxin 1, Parkinson disease 7, and stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 can contribute to the secondary injury of spinal cord. Decreases of development-related 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase and stathmin 1 may be not propitious for spinal cord regeneration. On the other hand, increases of isocitrate dehydrogenase 3 alpha/gamma and glutamate dehydrogenase 1 can help compensate the impaired energy metabolism. Increases of sirtuin 2, crystallin alpha B (CRYAB), and heat shock 27-kDa protein 1 can help resist stresses induced by injury. Increases of adenylate cyclase-associated protein 1 and galactose binding lectin 3 can help regeneration by replaying their roles in neural development. To our knowledge, this is the first case of characterization of the proteomic changes seen in the precipitated fraction of injured spinal cord. Most of the identified proteins were found for the first time to be differentially expressed after spinal cord injury, which may provide new clues about the molecular mechanisms of spinal cord injury and repair.

AB  - Proteomics is an increasingly powerful technology that can provide in-depth insights into entire proteomes and their variation upon disease. Large-scale proteomics today enables identification and measurement of changes of thousands of proteins from minute amount of tissues. Here, we provide a proteomic profile of three distinct parts of the murine nerve system: cerebellum, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve. We focus on membrane proteins as the key regulators of neural transmission and memory. Rat tissues were homogenized and extracted to remove nonmembrane proteins and the resulting membranes were solubilized with detergents. Proteins were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography, depleted for detergents, digested and analyzed by LC-MS/MS using the LTQ-Orbitrap instrument. With the application of stringent identification criteria, in total, 4124 proteins were identified. Of these proteins, 3528, 3290, and 1649 were mapped to cerebellum, spinal cord, and sciatic nerve, respectively, allowing in-depth mapping of neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, and transporter proteins. This work is the most in-depth proteomic analysis of nerve tissues to date and provides the first unbiased insights into the proteomes of anatomically and functionally distinct parts of the membrane proteome of the central and peripheral nerve systems. The methods applied here can be directly applied to studying nerve systems and their disorders.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) can cause severe loss of locomotor and sensory activities, with no ideal treatment. Emerging reports suggest that the helminth therapy is highly effective in relieving numerous inflammatory diseases. Proteomic profiling is often used to elucidate the underlying mechanism behind SCI. Herein, we sys-tematically compared the protein expression profiles of murine SCI spinal cord and Trichinella spiralis treated murine SCI spinal cord, using a 4D label-free technique known for its elevated sensitivity. Relative to the SCI mice, the T. spiralis-treated mice exhibited marked alterations in 91 proteins (31 up-and 60 down-regulated). Based on our Gene Ontology (GO) functional analysis, the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were pri-marily enriched in the processes of metabolism, biological regulation, cellular process, antioxidant activity, and other cell functions. In addition, according to the Clusters of Orthologous Groups of protein/EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups (COG/KOG) functional stratification, proteins involved in signaling transduction mecha-nisms belonged to the largest category. Over-expressed DEPs were also enriched in the "NADPH oxidase com-plex", "superoxide anion generation", "other types of O-glycan biosynthesis", and "HIF-1 signaling pathway". Furthermore, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network identified the leading 10 hub proteins. In conclusion, we highlighted the dynamic proteomic profiling of T. spiralis-treated SCI mice. Our findings provide significant insight into the molecular mechanism behind T. spiralis regulation of SCI.

AB  - Objectives Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) provides relief for patients suffering from chronic neuropathic pain although its mechanism may not be as dependent on electrical interference as classically considered. Recent evidence has been growing regarding molecular changes that are induced by SCS as being a key player in reversing the pain process. Here, we observed the effect of SCS on altering protein expression in spinal cord tissue using a proteomic analysis approach. Methods A microlead was epidurally implanted following induction of an animal neuropathic pain model. After the model was established, stimulation was applied for 72 hours continuously followed by tissue collection and proteomic analysis via tandem mass spectroscopy. Identified proteins were run through online data bases for protein identification and classification of biological processes. Results A significant improvement in mechanical sensitivity was observed following 48 hours of SCS therapy. Proteomic analysis identified 5840 proteins, of which 155 were significantly affected by SCS. Gene ontology data bases indicated that a significant number of proteins were associated to stress response, oxidation/reduction, or extracellular matrix pathways. Additionally, many of the proteins identified also play a role in neuron-glial interactions and are involved in nociception. Conclusions The development of an injury unbalances the proteome of the local neural tissue, neurons, and glial cells, and shifts the proteomic profile to a pain producing state. This study demonstrates the reversal of the injury-induced proteomic state by applying conventional SCS therapy. Additional studies looking at variations in electrical parameters are needed to optimize SCS.

AB  - Methylmercury (MeHg) is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the chemicals of greatest public health concern. Although central nervous system (CNS) is the main target organ, the effects over the spinal cord are not well understood, especially in chronic exposure at similar doses to those faced by humans. This study aimed to investigate possible changes on global proteomic profile and oxidative biochemistry status of rats spinal cord, related to the maintenance and balance of the organism functioning, mimicking a human daily exposure by diet (chronic and with relatively low levels). For this, 28 adults male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: MeHg group, which was intoxicated by intragastric gavage with MeHg at a dose of 0.04 mg/kg/day for 60 days, and control group, that received only vehicle. After the exposure period, the spinal cords were collected for evaluation of total mercury levels, proteomic profile, with further bioinformatic overrepresentation analysis (ORA), and oxidative biochemistry, by analyzing the antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (ACAP), lipid peroxidation (LPO), nitrite levels, measurement of Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC) and Reduced Glutathione (GSH). The MeHg exposure increased total mercury levels in spinal cord parenchyma, which increased lipid peroxidation and nitrite levels , and reduced antioxidant status. The proteomic analysis showed several proteins related to biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. Moreover, according to the ORA analysis, the proteins are involved in processes such as mitochondrial activity, stress response, cytoskeleton and apoptosis. Therefore, we concluded that exposure to low doses of MeHg can activate the oxidative stress pathway and thus, modulate the status of regulation of several important proteins.

AB  - AIM: To investigate proteomic changes in spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of rats with trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis.
   METHODS: The colonic myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) level were determined. A two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE)-based proteomic technique was used to profile the global protein expression changes in the DRG and spinal cord of the rats with acute colitis induced by intracolonic injection of TNBS.
   RESULTS: TNBS group showed significantly elevated colonic MPO activity and increased TNF-alpha level. The proteins derived from lumbosacral enlargement of the spinal cord and DRG were resolved by 2-DE; and 26 and 19 proteins that displayed significantly different expression levels in the DRG and spinal cord were identified respectively. Altered proteins were found to be involved in a number of biological functions, such as inflammation/immunity, cell signaling, redox regulation, sulfate transport and cellular metabolism. The overexpression of the protein similar to potassium channel tetramerisation domain containing protein 12 (Kctd 12) and low expression of proteasome subunit alpha type-1 (psma) were validated by Western blotting analysis.
   CONCLUSION: TNBS-induced colitis has a profound impact on protein profiling in the nervous system. This result helps understand the neurological pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. (C) 2012 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) induces a progressive pathophysiology affecting cell survival and neurological integrity via complex and evolving molecular cascades whose interrelationships are not fully understood. Acute injury to the spinal cord undergoes sequential pathological change including hemorrhage, edema, axonal and neuronal necrosis, and demyelination. In the present study, we aimed to establish the proteomic profiles and characterization of the total protein expressed in traumatic injured spinal cord tissue by using 2-DE and matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization-TOF MS (MALDI-TOF MS). We performed proteomic analysis using 2-DE and MS to describe total proteins and differential proteins expression between normal and traumatic injured spinal cord tissues. The study discovered 947 total proteins and analyzed 219 and 270 proteins from normal and injured tissue, respectively. After 24 h of traumatic damage induction, the injured spinal cord tissue up-regulated over 39 proteins including neurofilament light chain, annexin 5, heat shock protein, tubulin beta, peripherin, glial fibrillary acidic protein delta, peroxiredoxin 2, and apolipoprotein A. Twenty-one proteins showed reduction. The majority of the modulated proteins belonged to the 13 functional categories. Proteins that were identified with neural functional category in injured tissue were considered most likely to be involved in wound healing response coupled with neurogenesis and gliogenesis.

AB  - Central post-stroke pain (CPSP) is one of the complications of cerebral ischemia and neuropathic pain syndrome. At present, there are few studies of pain in regions such as the spinal cord or sciatic nerve in cerebral ischemic animal models. To identify proteomic changes in the spinal cord and sciatic nerve in global cerebral ischemic model mice, in the present study we performed an investigation using proteomic methods. In a comparison between the intensity of protein spots obtained from a sham and that from a bilateral carotid artery occulusion (BCAO) in spinal cord and sciatic nerve, the levels of 10 (spinal cord) and 7 (sciatic nerve) protein spots were altered. The protein levels in the spinal cord were significantly increased in N-G,N-G-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1), 6-phosphogluconolactonase isoform 1, and precursor apoprotein A-I and decreased in dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (CRMP-2), enolase 1B, rab guano sine 5'-diphosphate (GDP) dissociation inhibitor beta, septin-2 isoform a, isocitrate dehydrogenase subunit alpha, cytosolic malate dehydrogenase, and adenosine triphosphate synthase. The protein levels in the sciatic nerve were significantly increased in a mimecan precursor, myosin light chain 1/3, and myosin regulatory light chain 2 (MLC2), and decreased in dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 3 (CRMP-4), protein disulfide-isomerase A3, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 1, and B-type creatine kinase. In addition, CRMP-2 and CRMP-4 protein levels were decreased, and DDAH1 and MLC2 protein levels were increased on day 1 after BCAO using Western blotting. These results suggested that changes in these proteins may be involved in the regulation of CPSP.

AB  - Background: We aimed to gain new insights into the pathogenesis of sporadic ALS (sALS) through a comprehensive proteomic analysis. Methods: Protein profiles of the anterior and posterior horn in post-mortem spinal cord samples of 10 ALS patients and 10 controls were analysed using 2D-differential gel electrophoresis. The identified protein spots with statistically significant level changes and a spot ratio >2.0 were analysed by LC-MS/MS. Results: In the posterior horn only 3 proteins were differentially expressed. In the anterior horn, 16 proteins with increased levels and 2 proteins with decreased levels were identified in ALS compared to controls. The identified proteins were involved in mitochondrial metabolism, calcium homeostasis, protein metabolism, glutathione homeostasis, protein transport and snRNP assembly. The two proteins with decreased levels, ATP5D and calmodulin, were validated by Western blot and immunostaining. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent double staining of ATP5D and synaptophysin showed that the reduction of ATP5D was most pronounced at synapses. Conclusions: We speculate that mitochondrial dysfunction in synaptic clefts could play an important role in sALS pathogenesis. A similar approach revealed decreased calmodulin expression mainly in the neuronal body and dendrites of ALS patients. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the disease process underlying ALS.

AB  - Objective: Severe pressure ulcers (PUs) do not respond to conservative wound therapy and need surgical repair. To better understand the pathogenesis and to advance on new therapeutic options, we focused on the proteomic analysis of PU, which offers substantial opportunities to identify significant changes in protein abundance during the course of PU formation in an unbiased manner. Approach: To better define the protein pattern of this pathology, we performed a proteomic approach in which we compare severe PU tissue from spinal cord injury (SCI) patients with control tissue from the same patients. Results: We found 76 proteins with difference in abundance. Of these, 10 proteins were verified as proteins that define the pathology: antithrombin-III, alpha-1-antitrypsin, kininogen-1, alpha-2-macroglobulin, fibronectin, apolipoprotein A-I, collagen alpha-1 (XII) chain, haptoglobin, apolipoprotein B-100, and complement factor B. Innovation: This is the first study to analyze differential abundance protein of PU tissue from SCI patients using high-throughput protein identification and quantification by tandem mass tags followed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Conclusion: Differential abundance proteins are mainly involved in tissue regeneration. These proteins might be considered as future therapeutic options to enhance the physiological response and permit cellular repair of damaged tissue.

AB  - CLN1 disease is a fatal inherited neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease of early childhood, caused by mutations in the CLN1 gene, which encodes the enzyme Palmitoyl protein thioesterase-1 (PPT-1). We recently found significant spinal pathology in Ppt1-deficient (Ppt1(-/-)) mice and human CLN1 disease that contributes to clinical outcome and precedes the onset of brain pathology. Here, we quantified this spinal pathology at 3 and 7 months of age revealing significant and progressive glial activation and vulnerability of spinal interneurons. Tandem mass tagged proteomic analysis of the spinal cord of Ppt1(-/-)and control mice at these timepoints revealed a significant neuroimmune response and changes in mitochondrial function, cell-signalling pathways and developmental processes. Comparing proteomic changes in the spinal cord and cortex at 3 months revealed many similarly affected processes, except the inflammatory response. These proteomic and pathological data from this largely unexplored region of the CNS may help explain the limited success of previous brain-directed therapies. These data also fundamentally change our understanding of the progressive, site-specific nature of CLN1 disease pathogenesis, and highlight the importance of the neuroimmune response. This should greatly impact our approach to the timing and targeting of future therapeutic trials for this and similar disorders.

AB  - Mercury chloride (HgCl2) is a chemical pollutant widely found in the environment. This form of mercury is able to promote several damages to the Central Nervous System (CNS), however the effects of HgCl2 on the spinal cord, an important pathway for the communication between the CNS and the periphery, are still poorly understood. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of HgCl2 exposure on spinal cord of adult rats. For this, animals were exposed to a dose of 0.375 mg/kg/day, for 45 days. Then, they were euthanized, the spinal cord collected and we investigated the mercury concentrations in medullary parenchyma and the effects on oxidative biochemistry, proteomic profile and tissue structures. Our results showed that exposure to this metal promoted increased levels of Hg in the spinal cord, impaired oxidative biochemistry by triggering oxidative stress, mudulated antioxidant system proteins, energy metabolism and myelin structure; as well as caused disruption in the myelin sheath and reduction in neuronal density. Despite the low dose, we conclude that prolonged exposure to HgCl2 triggers biochemical changes and modulates the expression of several proteins, resulting in damage to the myelin sheath and reduced neuronal density in the spinal cord.

AB  - Spinal arteriovenous malformations (sAVM) are rare and heterogeneous group of blood vessel disorders that affect spinal cord function directly or indirectly; however, the pathogenesis of sAVM is still unclear. In this study, we compared four sAVM specimens obtained during surgery and donated control samples in a Tandem Mass Tag (TMT)-labeled proteomic analysis. We identified 3101 proteins, 654 of which were differentially expressed in sAVM samples compared with the controls. Of these, 96 proteins were upregulated and 358 proteins were downregulated. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that extracellular matrix organization in the biological process category and integrin-binding proteins in the molecular function category were the most enriched items. Two significant differentially expressed proteins (MYLK and MMP9) were verified by Western blot analysis. The pathway analysis indicated that the differentially expressed proteins in the pathways of angiogenesis, focal adhesion and cytoplasmic ribosome contributed to sAVM. The changes in protein profiles identified in this proteomic study provide an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of sAVM. The proteomics data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD007982.

AB  - The proteomic analysis of tissue samples is an analytical challenge, because identified gene products not only have to be assigned to subcellular structures, but also to cell subpopulations. We here report a strategy of combined subcellular proteomic profiling and in situ hybridization to assign proteins to subcellular sites in subsets of cells within the dorsal region of rat spinal cord. With a focus on synaptic membranes, which represent a complex membrane protein structure composed of multiple integral membrane proteins and networks of accessory structural proteins, we also compared different two-dimensional gel electrophoresis systems for the separation of the proteins. Using MALDI mass spectrometric protein identification based on peptide mass fingerprints, we identified in total 122 different gene products within the different synaptic membrane subfractions. The tissue structure of the dorsal region of the spinal cord is complex, and different layers of neurons can be distinguished neuroanatomically. Proteomic data combined with an in situ hybridization analysis for the detection of mRNA was used to assign selected gene products, namely the optical atrophy protein OPA-1, the presynaptic cytomatrix protein KIAA0378/CAST1, and the uncharacterized coiled-coil-helix-coiled-coil-helix domain containing protein 3 (hypothetical protein FLJ20420), to cell subsets of the dorsal area of the spinal cord. Most striking, KIAA0378/CAST1 mRNA was found only sparsely within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, but highly abundant within the dorsal root ganglion. This finding, combined with the identification of KlAA0378/CAST1 within the synaptic membrane fraction of the spinal cord at the protein level, are consistent with the reported presynaptic localization of CAST, predominantly within the tissue we investigated primarily attributable to primary afferent sensory neurons. Our approach may be of use in broader studies to characterize the proteomes of neural tissue.

AB  - Chronic lameness affects bovine welfare and has a negative economic impact in dairy industry. Moreover, due to the translational gap between traditional pain models and new drugs development for treating chronic pain states, naturally occurring painful diseases could be a potential translational tool for chronic pain research. We therefore employed liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to stablish the proteomic profile of the spinal cord samples from lumbar segments (L2-L4) of chronic lame dairy cows. Data were validated and quantified through software tool (Scaffold (R) v 4.0) using output data from two search engines (SEQUEST (R) and X-Tandem (R)). Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) analysis was performed to detect proteins interactions. LC-MS/MS identified a total amount of 177 proteins; of which 129 proteins were able to be quantified. Lame cows showed a strong upregulation of interacting proteins with chaperone and stress functions such as Hsp70 (p < 0.006), Hsc70 (p < 0.0079), Hsp90 (p < 0.015), STIP (p > 0.0018) and Grp78 (p <0.0068), and interacting proteins associated to glycolytic pathway such as; gamma-enolase (p < 0.0095), alpha-enolase (p < 0.013) and hexokinase-1 (p < 0.028). It was not possible to establish a clear network of interaction in several upregulated proteins in lame cows. Non-interacting proteins were mainly associated to redox process and cytoskeletal organization. The most relevant down regulated protein in lame cows was myelin basic protein (MBP) (p < 0.02). Chronic inflammatory lameness in cows is associated to increased expression of stress proteins with chaperone, metabolism, redox and structural functions. A state of endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) might explain the changes in protein expression in lame cows; however, further studies need to be performed in order to confirm these findings.

AB  - The wobbler mouse is a model of selective motor neuron degeneration in the cervical spinal cord. Comparing cervical and lumbar tracts of control and diseased mice at the early stage of pathology by proteomic analysis, we identified 31 proteins by peptide mass fingerprint after tryptic digestion and MALDI-TOF analysis, that were differently represented among the four experimental groups. In healthy mice, patterns of protein expression differed between cervical and lumbar tract: proteins of cellular energetic metabolism pathway showed lower expression in the cervical tract, while cellular trafficking proteins were overrepresented. In wobbler mice, these differences disappeared and the expression pattern was similar between cervical and lumbar spinal cord. We found that most of the proteins differentially regulated in wobbler with respect to control cervical tract were related to astrogliosis or involved in glutamate-glutamine cycle, energy transduction and redox functions. Proteins overrepresented in the wobbler lumbar spinal cord were cytoskeleton proteins and cellular transport proteins, in particular the vesicle fusing ATPase and the isoform 2 of syntaxin-binding protein 1, involved in vesicle trafficking. We suggest that overexpression of proteins involved in vesicle trafficking, together with proteins counteracting mitochondrial dysfunction can have neuroprotective effects, preserving lumbar spinal cord motor neurons in wobbler mice.

AB  - Objective Proteomic elucidation is an essential step in improving our understanding of the biological properties of proteins in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).Methods Preliminary proteomic analysis was performed on the spinal cord and brain of SOD1 G93A (TG) and wild-type (WT) mice using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation.Results Partial up- and downregulated proteins showing significant differences between TG and WT mice were identified, of which 105 proteins overlapped with differentially expressed proteins in both the spinal cord and brain of progression mice. Bioinformatic analyses using Gene Ontology, a cluster of orthologous groups, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway revealed that the significantly up- and downregulated proteins represented multiple biological functions closely related to ALS, with 105 overlapping differentially expressed proteins in the spinal cord and brain at the progression stage of TG mice closely related to 122 pathways. Differentially expressed proteins involved in a set of molecular functions play essential roles in maintaining neural cell survival.Conclusion This study provides additional proteomic profiles of TG mice, including potential overlapping proteins in both the spinal cord and brain that participate in pathogenesis, as well as novel insights into the up- and downregulation of proteins involved in the pathogenesis of ALS.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a serious condition often affecting young and healthy individuals around the world. Electro-acupuncture (EA) has been proven to contribute towards neurologic and functional recoveries in SCI, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown especially regarding neural specific proteins involved in the development of EA. The protein expression profile of spinal cord in both SCI and EA treatment models was analyzed by using two-dimensional electrophoresis-based proteomics. Using a MALDI-TOF/TOF MS and subsequent protein database searching, we identified changes in 15 proteins in the spinal cord following Governor Vessel (CV) EA treatment on SCI. These proteins are involved in inflammation, cell adhesion and migration, signal transduction and apoptosis processes. We selected 2 proteins (ANXA5 and CRMP2) beneficial to neuronal survival and axonal regeneration, and further identified these protein changes using Western blot analysis. Subsequently, Nissl staining and immunofluorescence double labeling approaches were used to explore possible role of the two neural specific proteins in the process of GV-EA treatment on SCI. Our results suggest that ANXA5 and CRMP2 may be neural specific proteins in the process of GV-EA treatment on SCI. This work might contribute to the better understanding of the mechanism involved in EA treatment on SCI at protein levels and provide a new therapeutic strategy for SCI (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the japan Neuroscience Society.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), collectively termed neurotrauma, are two parallel neurological conditions that can cause long-lasting neurological impairment and other comorbidities in patients, while at the same time, can create a high burden to society. To date, there are still no FDA-approved therapeutic interventions for either TBI or SCI. Recent advances in proteomic technologies, including tandem mass spectrometry, as well as imaging mass spectrometry, have enabled new approaches to study the differential proteome in TBI and SCI with the use of either animal disease models and/or biosamples from clinical observational studies. Thus, the applications of state-ofthe- art proteomic method hold promises in shedding light on identifying clinically useful neurotrauma "biomarkers" and/or in identifying distinct and, otherwise, unobvious systems pathways or "key drivers" that can be further exploited as new therapeutic intervention targets.

AB  - The emerging tissue-engineered bio-assemblies are revolutionizing the regenerative medicine, and provide a potential program to guarantee predictive performance of stem-cell-derived treatments in vivo and hence support their clinical translation. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) showed the attractive potential for the therapy of nervous system injuries, especially spinal cord injury (SCI), and yet failed to make an impact on clinical outcomes. Herein, under the guidance of the embryonic development theory that appropriate cellular coarctations or clustering are pivotal initiators for the formation of geometric and functional tissue structures, a developmentally engineered strategy was established to assemble DPMSCs into a bio-assembly termed Spinor through a three-level sequential induction programme including reductant, energy and mechanical force stimulation. Spinor exhibited similar geometric construction with spinal cord tissue and attain autonomy to released exosome with the optimized quantity and quality for suppressing cicatrization and inflammation and promoting axonal regeneration. As a spinal cord fascia and exosome mothership, Spinor guided the in-situ neuroplasticity of spinal cord in vivo, and caused the significant motor improvement, sensory recovery, and faster urinary reflex restoration in rats following SCI, while maintaining a highly favorable biosafety profile. Collectively, Spinor not only is a potentially clinical therapeutic paradigm as a living "exosome mothership" for revisiting Prometheus' Myth in SCI, but can be viewed allowing developmentally engineered manufacturing of biomimetic bio-assemblies with complex topology features and inbuilt biofunction attributes towards the regeneration of complex tissues including nervous system.

AB  - Development of progressive muscle spasticity resulting from spinal traumatic injury can be mediated by loss of local segmental inhibition and/or by an increased sensory afferent drive with resulting exacerbated a-motoneuron activity. To identify potential contributions of neuroactive substances in the development of such spasticity state, we employed a well-defined spinal injury-evoked spasticity rat model. Signaling molecules were analyzed in the spinal parenchyma below the level of spinal injury and in the corresponding dorsal root ganglion cells using Kinex (TM) antibody microarrays. The results uncovered the involvement of angiogenesis and neurodegeneration pathways together with direct cross-talk mediated by several hub proteins with SH-2 domains. At 2 and 5 weeks after transection, up-regulation of several proteins including CaMKIV, RON alpha and PKC delta as well as MAPK3/ERK1 phosphorylation was observed in the spinal ventral horns. Our results indicate that these signaling molecules and their neuronal effector systems cannot only play an important role in the initiation but also in the maintenance of spasticity states after spinal trauma. The exclusivity of specific protein changes observed in lumbar spinal parenchyma but not in dorsal root ganglia indicates that new treatment strategies should primarily target specific spinal segments to prevent or attenuate spasticity states.
   Biological significance
   Development of progressive muscle spasticity and rigidity represents a serious complication associated with spinal ischemic or traumatic injury. Signaling proteins, including their phosphorylation status, were analyzed in the spinal parenchyma below the level of spinal injury and in the corresponding dorsal root ganglion cells in a rat model of spinal injury using Kinex (TM) antibody microarrays. The results uncovered direct protein interaction mediated cross-talk between angiogenesis and neurodegeneration pathways, which may significantly contribute to the healing process in the damaged region. Importantly, we identified several target proteins exclusively observed in the spinal lumbar ventral horns, where such proteins may not only play an important role in the initiation but also in the maintenance of spasticity states after spinal trauma. Hence, potential new treatment strategies such as gene silencing or drug treatment should primarily target spinal parenchymal sites at and around the injury epicenter and most likely employ intrathecal or targeted spinal segment-specific vector or drug delivery. We believe that this work will stimulate future translational research, ultimately leading to the improvement of quality of life of patients with spinal traumatic injury. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate protein expression profile and to quantify proteins present in seminal plasma from men with spinal cord injury (SCI) and healthy men without SCI.
   Design: Experimental study.
   Setting: University hospital.
   Patient(s): Twelve SCI patients divided into two groups, six who underwent electroejaculation (EEJ) and six who underwent penile vibratory stimulation (PVS); and ten control subjects presenting normal sperm motility and concentration.
   Intervention(s): EEJ and PVS.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): The seminal plasma protein profile was analyzed by two proteomic strategies: data-independent label-free quantitative proteomics (MSE) and two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D SDS-PAGE).
   Result(s): A total of 638 different proteins were identified by MSE and 18 by 2D SDS-PAGE followed by tandem mass spectrometry. Interactome analysis showed key reproductive biologic processes-insemination, sperm and oocyte fusion, and acrosome reaction-related to all groups, as were triglyceride stimuli. Processes related to actin and muscle function and to iron oxidation, transportation, and homeostasis were found only in the EEJ and PVS groups; response to hydrogen peroxide and increased immune response was found only in the PVS group.
   Conclusion(s): This study was able to demonstrate differential protein expression among control, PVS, and EEJ groups; SCI is responsible for alterations in seminal plasma protein profile leading to a deviation from homeostasis; proteins reported in both PVS and EEJ groups correlate with the pathophysiology of SCI-related infertility.

AB  - Neural cell interventions in spinal cord injury (SCI) have focused predominantly on transplanted multipotent neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) for animal research and clinical use due to limited information on survival of spinal neurons. However, transplanted NSPC fate is unpredictable and largely governed by injury-derived matrix and cytokine factors that are often gliogenic and inflammatory. Here, using a rat cervical hemicontusion model, we evaluate the survival and integration of hiPSC-derived spinal motor neurons (SMNs) and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). SMNs and OPCs were differentiated in vitro through a neuromesodermal progenitor stage to mimic the natural origin of the spinal cord. We demonstrate robust survival and engraftment without additional injury site modifiers or neuroprotective biomaterials. Ex vivo differentiated neurons achieve cervical spinal cord matched transcriptomic and proteomic profiles, meeting functional electrophysiology parameters prior to transplantation. These data establish an approach for ex vivo developmentally accurate neuronal fate specification and subsequent transplantation for a more streamlined and predictable outcome in neural cell-based therapies of SCI.

AB  - Inflammation or trauma occurring on one side of the body can cause pathological pain on the contralateral noninjured side in a phenomenon called mirror-image pain (MIP). Although some potential mechanisms involved in MIP have been reported, including those involving the immune system and glial cells as well as neural mechanisms, the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. In this study, we aimed to understand the molecular mechanisms in MIP using quantitative proteomics and whole-cell patch clamp recordings. Behavioral test results showed that complete Freund's adjuvant could induce MIP in the mice. The results of isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) quantitative proteomics showed that 108 proteins were dysregulated, and these proteins may represent potential targets. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis was applied to explore the potential molecular mechanisms during MIP after complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) treatment. Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) results showed that PKC delta and seven other dysregulated proteins were related to MIP after CFA treatment. Patch clamp recording results showed that CFA treatment could increase intrinsic excitability and spontaneous firing in spinal cord neurons during MIP. In summary, we found that CFA could induce MIP. The results of proteomic research on the spinal cord after CFA treatment could provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of MIP. Moreover, the neuronal activity of spinal cord neurons was upregulated during MIP after CFA treatment. In summary, the results of the spinal cord proteomic profile provide a potential molecular mechanism for understanding MIP. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a severe neurological condition that frequently leads to significant sensory, motor, and autonomic dysfunction. This study sought to delineate the potential mechanistic underpinnings of extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from ginsenoside Rg1-pretreated neuronal cells (Rg1-EVs) in ameliorating SCI. These results demonstrated that treatment with Rg1-EVs substantially improved motor function in spinal cord-injured mice. Rg1-EVs enhance microglial polarization toward the M2 phenotype and repressed oxidative stress, thereby altering immune responses and decreasing inflammatory cytokine secretion. Moreover, Rg1-EVs substantially diminish reactive oxygen species accumulation and enhanced neural tissue repair by regulating mitochondrial function. Proteomic profiling highlighted a significant enrichment of MYCBP2 in Rg1-EVs, and functional assays confirmed that MYCBP2 knockdown counteracted the beneficial effects of Rg1-EVs in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MYCBP2 is implicated in the ubiquitination and degradation of S100A9, thereby promoting microglial M2-phenotype polarization and reducing oxidative stress. Overall, these findings substantiated the pivotal role of Rg1-EVs in neuronal protection and functional recovery following SCI through MYCBP2-mediated ubiquitination of S100A9. This research offers novel mechanistic insights into therapeutic strategies against SCI and supports the clinical potential of Rg1-EVs.
   The study reveals the potential mechanism by which extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from ginsenoside Rg1-pretreated neuronal cells (Rg1-EVs) promote functional recovery after spinal cord injury. These findings demonstrate that Rg1-EVs enhance motor function recovery in mice by enhancing microglia's polarization toward the M2 phenotype and reducing oxidative stress, driven by MYCBP2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of S100A9. image

AB  - The brain is a vital organ and because it is well shielded from the outside environment, possibilities for noninvasive analysis are often limited. Instead, fluids taken from the spinal cord or circulatory system are preferred sources for the discovery of candidate markers within neurological diseases. In the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), we applied an affinity proteomic strategy and screened 22 plasma samples with 4595 antibodies (3450 genes) on bead arrays, then defined 375 antibodies (334 genes) for targeted analysis in a set of 172 samples and finally used 101 antibodies (43 genes) on 443 plasma as well as 573 cerebrospinal spinal fluid (CSF) samples. This revealed alteration of protein profiles in relation to MS subtypes for IRF8, IL7, METTL14, SLC30A7, and GAP43. Respective antibodies were subsequently used for immunofluorescence on human post-mortem brain tissue with MS pathology for expression and association analysis. There, antibodies for IRF8, IL7, and METTL14 stained neurons in proximity of lesions, which highlighted these candidate protein targets for further studies within MS and brain tissue. The affinity proteomic translation of profiles discovered by profiling human body fluids and tissue provides a powerful strategy to suggest additional candidates to studies of neurological disorders.

AB  - Multi-Epitope-Ligand-Carthography (MELC) allows consecutive immunohistochemical visualization of up to 100 proteins on the same tissue sample. Subsequent biomathematical analysis of these images allows a quantitative description of changes in protein networks. We used the MELC technology to study the effect of the nonopioid analgesic drug dipyrone on protein network profiles associated with arachidonic acid-dependent signaling pathways. MELC analysis with 31 different fluorescence-labeled tags was used to compare the effect of dipyrone on protein networks in spinal cords of mice with zymosan-induced hyperalgesia, a common model for inflammatory pain. We found that the number of motifs which describe the colocalization of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) or 12-LO with other proteins increased disproportionally after dipyrone treatment. Activation of 5-LO and 12-LO induces their translocation to membrane compartments which was also reflected by MELC results. Although no changes in 5-LO or 12-LO expression were seen by Western blot analysis or by immunohistochemistry in spinal cords of dipyrone-treated mice, the activation of both enzymes was verified by determining LO-products. Spinal amounts of 5(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and 12(S)-HETE, which are generated by 5-LO and 12-LO, respectively, were significantly increased in spinal cords of dipyrone-treated animals. In primary spinal cord neurons, dipyrone selectively and dose-dependently increased 5(S)-(HETE) and 12(S)-HETE synthesis. Thus, we show for the first time that monitoring protein network profiles by topological proteomic analysis is a useful tool to identify mechanisms of drug actions.

AB  - Prior studies showed that polyglutamine-expanded androgen receptor (AR) is aberrantly acetylated and that deacetylation of the mutant AR by overexpression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent (NAD+-dependent) sirtuin 1 is protective in cell models of spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA). Based on these observations and reduced NAD+ in muscles of SBMA mouse models, we tested the therapeutic potential of NAD+ restoration in vivo by treating postsymptomatic transgenic SBMA mice with the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (NR). NR supplementation failed to alter disease progression and had no effect on increasing NAD+ or ATP content in muscle, despite producing a modest increase of NAD+ in the spinal cords of SBMA mice. Metabolomic and proteomic profiles of SBMA quadriceps muscles indicated alterations in several important energy -related pathways that use NAD+, in addition to the NAD+ salvage pathway, which is critical for NAD+ regeneration for use in cellular energy production. We also observed decreased mRNA levels of nicotinamide riboside kinase 2 (Nmrk2), which encodes a key kinase responsible for NR phosphorylation, allowing its use by the NAD+ salvage pathway. Together, these data suggest a model in which NAD+ levels are significantly decreased in muscles of an SBMA mouse model and intransigent to NR supplementation because of decreased levels of Nmrk2.

AB  - Astrocytes and microglia play pivotal roles in central nervous system development, injury responses, and neurodegenerative diseases. These highly dynamic cells exhibit rapid responses to environmental changes and display significant heterogeneity in terms of morphology, transcriptional profiles, and functions. While our understanding of the functions of glial cells in health and disease has advanced substantially, there remains a need for in vitro, cell-specific analyses conducted in the context of insults or injuries to comprehensively characterize distinct cell populations. Isolating cells from the adult mouse offers several advantages over cell lines or neonatal animals, as it allows for the analysis of cells under pathological conditions and at specific time points. Furthermore, focusing on spinal cord-specific isolation, excluding brain involvement, enables research into spinal cord pathologies, including experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, spinal cord injury, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. This protocol presents an efficient method for isolating astrocytes and microglia from the adult mouse spinal cord, facilitating immediate or future analysis with potential applications in functional, molecular, or proteomic downstream studies.

AB  - The therapeutic use of RhoA inhibitors (RhoAi) has been experimentally tested in spinal cord injury (SCI). In order to decipher the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in such a process, an in vitro neuroproteomic-systems biology platform was developed in which the pan-proteomic profile of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cell line ND7/23 DRG was assessed in a large array of culture conditions using RhoAi and/or conditioned media obtained from SCI ex vivo derived spinal cord slices. A fine mapping of the spatio-temporal molecular events of the RhoAi treatment in SCI was performed. The data obtained allow a better understanding of regeneration/degeneration induced above and below the lesion site. Results notably showed a time-dependent alteration of the transcription factors profile along with the synthesis of growth cone-related factors (receptors, ligands, and signaling pathways) in RhoAi treated DRG cells. Furthermore, we assessed in a rat SCI model the in vivo impact of RhoAi treatment administered in situ via alginate scaffold that was combined with FK506 delivery. The improved recovery of locomotion was detected only at the early postinjury time points, whereas after overall survival a dramatic increase of synaptic contacts on outgrowing neurites in affected segments was observed. We validate these results by in vivo proteomic studies along the spinal cord segments from tissue and secreted media analyses, confirming the increase of the synaptogenesis expression factors under RhoAi treatment. Taken together, we demonstrate that RhoAi treatment seems to be useful to stimulate neurite outgrowth in both in vitro as well in vivo environments. However, for in vivo experiments there is a need for sustained delivery regiment to facilitate axon regeneration and promote synaptic reconnections with appropriate target neurons also at chronic phase, which in turn may lead to higher assumption for functional improvement.

AB  - Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a chronic multisymptom condition with a central nervous system (CNS) component, for which there is no treatment available. It is now believed that the combined exposure to Gulf War (GW) agents, including pyridostigmine bromide (PB) and pesticides, such as permethrin (PER), was a key contributor to the etiology of GWI. In this study, a proteomic approach was used to characterize the biomolecular disturbances that accompany neurobehavioral and neuropathological changes associated with combined exposure to PB and PER. Mice acutely exposed to PB and PER over 10 days showed an increase in anxiety-like behavior, psychomotor problems and delayed cognitive impairment compared to control mice that received vehicle only. Proteomic analysis showed changes in proteins associated with lipid metabolism and molecular transport in the brains of GW agent-exposed mice compared to controls. Proteins associated with the endocrine and immune systems were also altered, and dysfunction of these systems is a prominent feature of GWI. The presence of astrogliosis in the GW agent-exposed mice compared to control mice further suggests an immune system imbalance, as is observed in GWI. These studies provide a broad perspective of the molecular disturbances driving the late pathology of this complex illness. Evaluation of the potential role of these biological functions in GWI will be useful in identifying molecular pathways that can be targeted for the development of novel therapeutics against GWI.

AB  - Spinal muscular atrophy is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease caused by a genetic defect carried by as many as one in 75 people. Unlike most neurological disorders, we know exactly what the genetic basis is of the disorder, but in spite of this, have little understanding of why the low levels of one protein, survival motor neuron protein, results in the specific progressive die back of only one cell type in the body, the motor neuron. Given the fact that all cells in the body of a patient with spinal muscular atrophy share the same low abundance of the protein throughout development, an appropriate approach is to ask how lower levels of survival motor neuron protein affects the proteome of embryonic stem cells prior to development. Convergent biostatistical analyses of a discovery proteomic analysis of these cells provide results that are consistent with the pathomechanistic fate of the developed motor neuron.

AB  - The early and precise diagnosis, the prognosis, and the clinical management of multiple sclerosis, remain a considerable challenge. In recent years, the development of novel and powerful proteomic techniques prompted the use of these approaches for the search of unique biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid of multiple sclerosis patients. A few studies have also utilized proteomics to delineate the profile of differentially expressed proteins in animal models of the human disease in order to gain global insights into affected pathways. The identification of differentially expressed proteins may be an initial step in the discovery of novel targets and mechanisms that play critical roles in the pathology of multiple sclerosis. Based on these findings, future investigations may elucidate the events leading to demyelination, axonal damage, and neurodegeneration, providing better insights into mechanisms governing the onset and progression of the disease. Although these proteomic studies provide valuable information, they are also faced with a number of challenges. The present review discusses some of the strengths and limitations of proteomic investigations as applied to multiple sclerosis.

AB  - Robust protocols for directed differentiation of human pluripotent cells are required to determine whether mechanisms operating in model organisms are relevant to our own development. Recent work in vertebrate embryos has identified neuromesodermal progenitors as a bipotent cell population that contributes to paraxial mesoderm and spinal cord. However, precise protocols for in vitro differentiation of human spinal cord progenitors are lacking. Informed by signalling in amniote embryos, we show here that transient dual-SMAD inhibition, together with retinoic acid (dSMADi-RA), provides rapid and reproducible induction of human spinal cord progenitors from neuromesodermal progenitor-like cells. Using CRISPR-Cas9 to engineer human embryonic stem cells with a GFP-reporter for neuromesodermal progenitor-associated gene NKx1.2 we facilitate selection of this cell population. RNA-sequencing was then used to identify human and conserved neuromesodermal progenitor transcriptional signatures, to validate this differentiation protocol and to reveal new pathways/processes in human neural differentiation. This optimised protocol, novel reporter line and transcriptomic data am useful resources with which to dissect molecular mechanisms regulating human spinal cord generation and allow the scaling-up of distinct cell populations for global analyses, including proteomic, biochemical and chromatin interrogation.

AB  - One of the causes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is due to mutations in Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1). The mutant protein exhibits a toxic gain of function that adversely affects the function of neurons in the spinal cord, brain stem, and motor cortex. A proteomic analysis of protein expression in a widely used mouse model of ALS was undertaken to identify differences in protein expression in the spinal cords of mice expressing a mutant protein with the G93A mutation found in human ALS. Protein profiling was done on soluble and particulate fractions of spinal cord extracts using high throughput two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. An integrated proteomics-informatics platform was used to identify relevant differences in protein expression based upon the abundance of peptides identified by database searching of mass spectrometry data. Changes in the expression of proteins associated with mitochondria were particularly prevalent in spinal cord proteins from both mutant G93A-SOD1 and wild-type SOD1 transgenic mice. G93A-SOD1 mouse spinal cord also exhibited differences in proteins associated with metabolism, protein kinase regulation, antioxidant activity, and lysosomes. Using gene ontology analysis, we found an overlap of changes in mRNA expression in presymptomatic mice (from microarray analysis) in three different gene categories. These included selected protein kinase signaling systems, ATP-driven ion transport, and neurotransmission. Therefore, alterations in selected cellular processes are detectable before symptomatic onset in ALS mouse models. However, in late stage disease, mRNA expression analysis did not reveal significant changes in mitochondrial gene expression but did reveal concordant changes in lipid metabolism, lysosomes, and the regulation of neurotransmission. Thus, concordance of proteomic and mRNA expression data within multiple categories validates the use of gene ontology analysis to compare different types of "omic" data.

AB  - Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neuromuscular disorder caused by recessive pathogenic variants affecting the survival of motor neuron (SMN1) gene (localized on 5q). In consequence, cells lack expression of the corresponding protein. This pathophysiological condition is clinically associated with motor neuron (MN) degeneration leading to severe muscular atrophy. Additionally, vulnerability of other cellular populations and tissues including skeletal muscle has been demonstrated. Although the therapeutic options for SMA have considerably changed, treatment responses may differ thus underlining the persistent need for validated biomarkers. To address this need and to identify novel marker proteins for SMA, we performed unbiased proteomic profiling on cerebrospinal fluid derived (CSF) from genetically proven SMA type 1-3 cases and afterwards performed ELISA studies on CSF and serum samples to validate the potential of a novel biomarker candidates in both body fluids. To further decipher the pathophysiological impact of this biomarker, immunofluorescence studies were carried out on spinal cord and skeletal muscle derived from a 5q-SMA mouse model. Proteomics revealed increase of LARGE1 in CSF derived from adult patients showing a clinical response upon treatment with nusinersen. Moreover, LARGE1 levels were validated in CSF samples of further SMA patients (type 1-3) by ELISA. These studies also unveiled a distinguishment between groups in improvement of motor skills: adult patients do present with lowered level per se at baseline visit while no elevation upon treatment in the pediatric cohort can be observed. ELISA-based studies of serum samples showed no changes in the pediatric cohort but unraveled elevated level in adult patients responding to future intervention with nusinersen, while non-responders did not show a significant increase. Additional immunofluorescence studies of LARGE1 in MN and skeletal muscle of a SMA type 3 mouse model revealed an increase of LARGE1 during disease progression. Our combined data unraveled LARGE1 as a protein dysregulated in serum and CSF of SMA-patients (and in MN and skeletal muscle of SMA mice) holding the potential to serve as a disease marker for SMA and enabling to differentiate between patients responding and non-responding to therapy with nusinersen.

AB  - Treatment of cancer-induced bone pain (CIBP) is challenging in clinics. Oxycodone is used to treat CIBP. However, the lack of understanding of the mechanism of CIBP limits the application of oxycodone. In this study, proteomic profiling of oxycodone-treated spinal dorsal cord of rats with CIBP was performed. Briefly, a total of 3519 proteins were identified in the Sham group; 3505 proteins in the CIBP group; and 3530 proteins in the CIBP-OXY treatment group. The 2-fold cut-off value was used as the differential protein standard for abundance reduction or increase (p < 0.05). Significant differences were found in the abundance of 16 proteins between Sham and CIBP group; 11 proteins in the CIBP group had increased abundance while 5 proteins had reduced abundance. Furthermore, fifteen proteins with differential abundance were identified between the CIBP group and the OXY group. Compared with the CIBP group, there were six increased abundances and nine reduced abundances in the OXY group. In addition, a reduced expression of ADP-ribosylation factor-like 6 binding factor 1 (Arl6ip-1), an endoplasmic reticulum protein that has an important role in cell conduction and material transport, was found in the CIBP group compared with the Sham group. Its expression increased after the administration of OXY. Proteomics results were further verified by Western-blot. Fluorescent staining revealed that Arl6ip-1 co-localized with spinal dorsal horn neurons, but not with astrocytes or microglia. Based on the observed results, we believe that Arl6ip-1 may be a potential drug target for OXY treatment of CIBP rats.

AB  - Establishing proteomic biomarkers is critical for characterizing disease pathophysiology, identifying genetic risk factors, and predicting clinical outcomes. However, diseases like cervical spondylomyelopathy have not been actively characterized for molecular significance, leading to questions regarding the pathology's molecular mechanisms. Namely, spondylomyelopathy is a degenerative spinal disease that leads to compression and neurologic deficits in the spinal cord. Analyzing a patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has been well-known for revealing biomarkers that are associated with diseases of the central nervous system. Therefore, in this review, we will formulate a proteomic profile of spondylomyelopathy through a molecular analysis of the CSF. The proteins found to be upregulated in the CSF include vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP), gelsolin, creatine kinase B-type (CK-BB), and angiotensinogen. Meanwhile, the proteins that were downregulated include pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase (PGH2), apolipoprotein E (APOE), and clusterin. The cellular functions of these proteins are discussed, along with their relevance in manifesting spondylomyelopathy. However, further studies are warranted, as a lack of human studies is a major limiting factor. Nevertheless, based on the continued progression of the proteomic profile of spondylomyelopathy, new targets can be assessed as candidates for future therapeutic intervention.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, causing demyelination and inflammation in the central nervous system. The pathology of MS has been extensively studied using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model. However, the molecular mechanisms are still largely unclear and require further investigation. In this study, we carried out quantitative proteomic analysis of the brain and spinal cord tissues in mice induced with EAE using a data-independent acquisition strategy and identified 744 differentially regulated proteins in the brain and 741 in the spinal cord. The changed proteins were highly related with phagocytosis, lysosomal enzymes, inflammasome activation, complements, and synaptic loss processes. Moreover, gene set enrichment analysis revealed the elevation of the SUMOylation process in EAE with the increase of SUMOylation-related enzymes and modification targets. Furthermore, to test the possibility of treating MS by targeting SUMOylation, we explored the application of a selective SUMO E1 inhibitor, TAK-981. Intriguingly, TAK-981 suppressed the global SUMOylation level in the brain and significantly alleviated the symptoms of EAE in mice. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of MS pathology, reveal the important role of SUMOylation in disease progression, and demonstrate the potential of the SUMO E1 inhibitor as a novel treatment for MS.

AB  - sclerosis (MS) is a complex autoimmune and neurodegenerative disorder that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is characterized by a heterogeneous disease course involving demyelination and inflammation. In this study, we utilized two distinct animal models, cuprizone (CPZ)-induced demyelination and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), to replicate various aspects of the disease. We aimed to investigate the differential CNS responses by examining the proteomic profiles of EAE mice during the peak disease (15 days post-induction) and cuprizone-fed mice during the acute phase (38 days). Specifically, we focused on two different regions of the CNS: the dorsal cortex (Cx) and the entire spinal cord (SC). Our findings revealed varied glial, synaptic, dendritic, mitochondrial, and inflammatory responses within these regions for each model. Notably, we identified a single protein, Orosomucoid-1 (Orm1), also known as Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 (AGP1), that consistently exhibited alterations in both models and regions. This study provides insights into the similarities and differences in the responses of these regions in two distinct demyelinating models.(c) 2023 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To use a new, unbiased biomarker discovery strategy to obtain and assess proteomic data from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS)-related disorders. Methods: CSF protein profiles were analyzed from 107 patients with either MS-related disorders (including relapsing remitting MS [RRMS], primary progressive MS [PPMS], anti-aquaporin4 antibody seropositive-neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder [SP-NMOSD], and seronegative-NMOSD with long cord lesions on spinal magnetic resonance imaging [SN-NMOSD]), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or other inflammatory neurological diseases (used as controls). CSF peptides/ proteins were purified with magnetic beads, and directly measured by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The obtained spectra were analyzed with multivariate statistics and pattern matching algorithms. These analyses were replicated in an independent sample set of 84 patients composed of those with MS-related disorders or with other neurological diseases (the second cohort). Results: MS-related disorders differed considerably in terms of CSF protein profiles. SP-NMOSD and SN-NMOSD, both of which fit within the NMO spectrum, were distinguishable from RRMS with high cross-validation accuracy on a support vector machine classifier, especially in relapse phases. Some peaks derived from samples of relapsed SPNMOSD can discriminate RRMS with high area under curve scores (> 0.95) and this was reproduced on the second cohort. The similarity of proteomic patterns between selected neurological diseases were demonstrated by pattern matching analysis. To our surprise, the spectral differences between RRMS and PPMS were much larger than those of PPMS and ALS. Interpretation: Our findings suggest that CSF proteomic pattern analysis can increase the accuracy of disease diagnosis of MS-related disorders and will aid physicians in appropriate therapeutic decision-making.

AB  - center dot PURPOSE: To investigate the tear proteomic and neuromediator profiles, in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) imaging features, and clinical manifestations in neuropathic corneal pain (NCP) patients. center dot DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. center dot METHODS: A total of 20 NCP patients and 20 agematched controls were recruited. All subjects were evaluated by corneal sensitivity, Schirmer test, tear break-up time, and corneal and ocular surface staining, Ocular Surface Disease Index and Ocular Pain Assessment Survey questionnaires were administered, as well as IVCM examinations for corneal nerves, microneruomas, and epithelial and dendritic cells. Tears were collected for neuromediator and proteomic analysis using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry. center dot RESULTS: Burning and sensitivity to light were the 2 most common symptoms in NCP. A total of 188 significantly dysregulated proteins, such as elevated metallothionein-2, creatine kinases B-type, vesicleassociated membrane protein 2, neurofilament light polypeptide, and myelin basic protein, were identified in the NCP patients. The top 10 dysregulated biological pathways in NCP include neurotoxicity, axonal signaling, wound healing, neutrophil degradation, apoptosis, thrombin signaling mitochondrial dysfunction, and RHOGDI and P70S6K signaling pathways. Compared to controls, the NCP cohort presented with significantly decreased corneal sensitivity ( P < .001), decreased corneal nerve fiber length ( P = .003), corneal nerve fiber density ( P = .006), and nerve fiber fractal dimension ( P = .033), as well as increased corneal nerve fiber width ( P = .002), increased length, total area and perimeter of microneuromas ( P < .001, P < .001, P = .019), smaller corneal epithelial size ( P = .017), and higher nerve growth factor level in tears ( P = .006). center dot CONCLUSIONS: These clinical manifestations, imaging features, and molecular characterizations would contribute to the diagnostics and potential therapeutic targets for NCP.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease whose pathophysiology is largely unknown. Despite the fact that motor neuron (MN) death is recognized as the key event in ALS, astrocytes dysfunctionalities and neuroinflammation were demonstrated to accompany and probably even drive MN loss. Nevertheless, the mechanisms priming astrocyte failure and hyperactivation are still obscure. In this work, altered pathways and molecules in ALS astrocytes were unveiled by investigating the proteomic profile and the secreted metabolome of primary spinal cord astrocytes derived from transgenic ALS mouse model overexpressing the human (h)SOD1(G93A) protein in comparison with the transgenic counterpart expressing hSOD1(WT) protein. Here we show that ALS primary astrocytes are depleted of proteins-and of secreted metabolites-involved in glutathione metabolism and signaling. The observed increased activation of Nf-kB, Ebf1, and Plag1 transcription factors may account for the augmented expression of proteins involved in the proteolytic routes mediated by proteasome or endosome-lysosome systems. Moreover, hSOD1(G93A) primary astrocytes also display altered lipid metabolism. Our results provide novel insights into the altered molecular pathways that may underlie astrocyte dysfunctionalities and altered astrocyte-MN crosstalk in ALS, representing potential therapeutic targets to abrogate or slow down MN demise in disease pathogenesis.

AB  - Molecular markers associated with CNS injury are of diagnostic interest. Mechanical trauma generates cellular deformation associated with membrane permeability with unknown molecular consequences. We used an in vitro model of stretch-injury and proteomic analyses to determine protein changes in murine astrocytes and their surrounding fluids. Abrupt pressure-pulse stretching resulted in the rapid release of 59 astrocytic proteins with profiles reflecting cell injury and cell death, i.e., mechanoporation and cell lysis. This acute trauma-release proteome was overrepresented with metabolic proteins compared with the uninjured cellular proteome, bearing relevance for post-traumatic metabolic depression. Astrocyte-specific deletion of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3-CKO) resulted in reduced stretch-injury tolerance, elevated necrosis and increased protein release. Consistent with more lysed cells, more protein complexes, nuclear and transport proteins were released from STAT3-CKO versus nontransgenic astrocytes. STAT3-CKO astrocytes had reduced basal expression of GFAP, lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB), aldolase C (ALDOC), and astrocytic phosphoprotein 15 (PEA15), and elevated levels of tropomyosin (TPM4) and actinin 4 (ACTN4). Stretching caused STAT3-dependent cellular depletion of PEA15 and GFAP, and its filament disassembly in subpopulations of injured astrocytes. PEA15 and ALDOC signals were low in injured astrocytes acutely after mouse spinal cord crush injury and were robustly expressed in reactive astrocytes 1 day postinjury. In contrast, crystallin (CRYAB) was present in acutely injured astrocytes, and absent from uninjured and reactive astrocytes, demonstrating novel marker differences among postinjury astrocytes. These findings reveal a proteomic signature of traumatically-injured astrocytes reflecting STAT3-dependent cellular survival with potential diagnostic value. GLIA 2016;64:668-694

AB  - Introduction Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is a rare type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that affects brain parenchyma, eyes, cerebrospinal fluid, and spinal cord. Diagnosing PCNSL can be challenging because imaging studies often show similar patterns as other brain tumors, and stereotactic brain lesion biopsy conformation is invasive and not always possible. This study aimed to validate a previous proteomic profiling (PMID: 32610669) of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and develop a CSF-based proteomic panel for accurate PCNSL diagnosis and differentiation.Methods CSF samples were collected from patients of 30 PCNSL, 30 other brain tumors, and 31 tumor-free/benign controls. Liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry targeted proteomics analysis was used to establish CSF-based proteomic panels.Results Final proteomic panels were selected and optimized to diagnose PCNSL from tumor-free controls or other brain tumor lesions with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.873 (95%CI: 0.723-0.948) and 0.937 (95%CI: 0.807- 0.985), respectively. Pathways analysis showed diagnosis panel features were significantly enriched in pathways related to extracellular matrices-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and PI3K-Akt signaling, while prion disease, mineral absorption and HIF-1 signaling were significantly enriched with differentiation panel features.Discussion This study suggests an accurate clinical test panel for PCNSL diagnosis and differentiation with CSF-based proteomic signatures, which may help overcome the challenges of current diagnostic methods and improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of motor neurons (MN) in the spinal cord leading to progressive muscle atrophy and weakness. SMA is caused by mutations in the survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) gene, resulting in reduced levels of survival motor neuron (SMN) protein. The mechanisms that link SMN deficiency to selective motor neuron dysfunction in SMA remain largely unknown. We present here, for the first time, a comprehensive quantitative TMT-10plex proteomics analysis that covers the development of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived MNs from both healthy individuals and SMA patients. We show that the proteomes of SMA samples segregate from controls already at early stages of neuronal differentiation. The altered proteomic signature in SMA MNs is associated with mRNA splicing, ribonucleoprotein biogenesis, organelle organization, cellular biogenesis, and metabolic processes. We highlight several known SMN-binding partners and evaluate their expression changes during MN differentiation. In addition, we compared our study to human and mouse in vivo proteomic studies revealing distinct and similar signatures. Altogether, our work provides a comprehensive resource of molecular events during early stages of MN differentiation, containing potentially therapeutically interesting protein expression profiles for SMA.

AB  - Pregabalin is a lipophilic amino acid derivative of gamma-amino butyric acid that displays anticonvulsant and analgesic activities against neuropathic pain. Although a role for glial cells as an important player in pain control and also as a new target for pain medicine has been suggested, the effect of pregabalin on glial cells has not been elucidated. In the present study, we have investigated the action of pregabalin on the glial cell proteome. To identify immediate early protein targets of pregabalin in glial cells, a differential proteomics approach in C6 rat glioma cells treated with pregabalin was used. Seven proteins that sensitively reacted to pregabalin treatment were identified using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and MALDI-TOF-MS (matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time-of-flight MS). The calcium-ion-binding chaperone, calreticulin, and the oxidative response protein, DJ-1, were up-regulated after pregabalin treatment. Hsp (heat-shock protein)-90-beta, cytoskeleton protein actin and myosin also showed quantitative expression profile differences. Functionally relevant to the proteome result, immediate actin depolymerization was observed after treatment with pregabalin. These results suggest a previously undefined role of pregabalin in the regulation of chaperone activity and cytoskeleton remodelling in glial cells.

AB  - Protein associated with Myc (PAM) is a giant E3 ubiquitin ligase of 510 kDa. Although the role of PAM during neuronal development is well established, very little is known about its function in the regulation of synaptic strength. Here we used multiepitope ligand cartography (MELC) to study protein network profiles associated with PAM during the modulation of synaptic strength. MELC is a novel imaging technology that utilizes biomathematical tools to describe protein networks after consecutive immunohistochemical visualization of up to 100 proteins on the same sample. As an in vivo model to modulate synaptic strength we used the formalin test, a common model for acute and inflammatory pain. MELC analysis was performed with 37 different antibodies or fluorescence tags on spinal cord slices and led to the identification of 1390 PAM-related motifs that distinguish untreated and formalin-treated spinal cords. The majority of these motifs related to ubiquitin-dependent processes and/or the actin cytoskeleton. We detected an intermittent colocalization of PAM and ubiquitin with TSC2, a known substrate of PAM, and the glutamate receptors mGluR5 and GLUR1. Importantly these complexes were detected exclusively in the presence of F-actin. A direct PAM/F-actin interaction was confirmed by colocalization and cosedimentation. The binding of PAM toward F-actin varied strongly between the PAM splice forms found in rat spinal cords. PAM did not ubiquitylate actin or alter actin polymerization and depolymerization. However, F-actin decreased the ubiquitin ligase activity of purified PAM. Because PAM activation is known to involve its translocation, the binding of PAM to F-actin may serve to control its subcellular localization as well as its activity. Taken together we show that defining protein network profiles by topological proteomics analysis is a useful tool to identify previously unknown protein/protein interactions that underlie synaptic processes.

AB  - Microglia, a primary immune effector cell of the central nervous system (CNS) affects homeostatic, neuroprotective, regenerative and degenerative outcomes in health and disease. Despite these broad neuroimmune activities linked to specific environmental cues, a precise cellular genetic profile for microglia in the context of disease and repair has not been elucidated. To this end we used nucleic acid microarrays, proteomics, immunochemical and histochemical tests to profile microglia in neuroprotective immune responses. Optic and sciatic nerve (ON and SN) fragments were used to stimulate microglia in order to reflect immune consequences of nervous system injury. Lipopolysaccharide and latex beads-induced microglial activation served as positive controls. Cytosolic and secreted proteins were profiled by surface enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight (SELDI-TOF) ProteinChip (R) 1 D and 2D difference gel electrophoresis. Proteins were identified by peptide sequencing with tandem mass spectrometry, ELISA and western blot tests. Temporal expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, antioxiclants, neurotrophins, and lysosomal enzyme expression provided, for the first time, a unique profile of secreted microglia proteins with neuroregulatory functions. Most importantly, this molecular and biochemical signature supports a broad range of microglial functions for debris clearance and promotion of neural repair after injury.

AB  - During the last decade, increasing evidence suggested that bone marrow stromal cells (MSCs) have the potential to differentiate into neural lineages. Many studies have reported that MSCs showed morphological changes and expressed a limited number of neural proteins under experimental conditions. However, no proteomic studies on MSCs differentiated into Schwann cell-like cells have been reported. In this study, we isolated MSCs from adult Sprague-Dawley rat femur and tibia bone marrows and induced the cells in vitro under specific conditions. By using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE), we compared the protein profiles of MSCs before and after induced differentiation. We obtained 792 protein spots in the protein profile by 2-DE, and found that 74 spots changed significantly before and after the differentiation using PDQuest software, with 43 up-regulated and 31 down-regulated. We analyzed these 74 spots by a matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) and by database searching, and found that they could be grouped into various classes, including cytoskeleton and structure proteins, growth factors, metabolic proteins, chaperone proteins, receptor proteins, cell cycle proteins, calcium binding proteins, and other proteins. These proteins also include neural and glial proteins, such as BDNF, CNTF and GFAP. The results may provide valuable proteomic information about the differentiation of MSCs into Schwann cell-like cells.

AB  - Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1) is the etiological agent of HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The endothelial breakdown and migration of leukocytes, including monocytes, to the spinal cord are involved in HAM/TSP development. Monocytes from HTLV-1-infected individuals exhibit important functional differences when compared to cells from uninfected donors. Using proteomic shot gun strategy, performed by nanoACQUITY-UPLC system, we analyzed monocytes isolated from peripheral blood of asymptomatic carriers (AC), HAM/TSP and uninfected individuals. 534 proteins were identified among which 376 were quantified by Expression(E) software. Our study revealed a panel of changes in protein expression linked to HTLV-1 infection. Upregulation of heat shock proteins and downregulation of canonical histone expression were observed in monocytes from HTLV-1-infected patients. Moreover, expression of cytoskeleton proteins was increased in monocytes from HTLV-1-infected patients, mainly in those from HAM/TSP, which was confirmed by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Importantly, functional assays demonstrated that monocytes from HAM/TSP patients present higher ability for adhesion and transmigration thought endothelium than those from AC and uninfected individuals. The major changes on monocyte protein profile were detected in HAM/TSP patients, suggesting that these alterations exert a relevant role in the establishment of HAM/TSP.

AB  - IntroductionModification of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is one of the major processes in the pathology of brain damage following an ischemic stroke. However, our understanding of how age-related ECM alterations may affect stroke pathophysiology and its outcome is still very limited.MethodsWe conducted an ECM-targeted re-analysis of our previously obtained RNA-Seq dataset of aging, ischemic stroke and their interactions in young adult (3-month-old) and aged (18-month-old) mice. The permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAo) in rodents was used as a model of ischemic stroke. Altogether 56 genes of interest were chosen for this study.ResultsWe identified an increased activation of the genes encoding proteins related to ECM degradation, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), proteases of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with the thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) family and molecules that regulate their activity, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Moreover, significant upregulation was also detected in the mRNA of other ECM molecules, such as proteoglycans, syndecans and link proteins. Notably, we identified 8 genes where this upregulation was enhanced in aged mice in comparison with the young ones. Ischemia evoked a significant downregulation in only 6 of our genes of interest, including those encoding proteins associated with the protective function of ECM molecules (e.g., brevican, Hapln4, Sparcl1); downregulation in brevican was more prominent in aged mice. The study was expanded by proteome analysis, where we observed an ischemia-induced overexpression in three proteins, which are associated with neuroinflammation (fibronectin and vitronectin) and neurodegeneration (link protein Hapln2). In fibronectin and Hapln2, this overexpression was more pronounced in aged post-ischemic animals.ConclusionBased on these results, we can conclude that the ratio between the protecting and degrading mechanisms in the aged brain is shifted toward degradation and contributes to the aged tissues' increased sensitivity to ischemic insults. Altogether, our data provide fresh perspectives on the processes underlying ischemic injury in the aging brain and serve as a freely accessible resource for upcoming research.

AB  - MRL/MpJ-Fas(lpr) mice exhibit the ability to regenerate ear tissue excised by dermal punches. This is an exceptional model to identify candidate proteins that may regulate regeneration in typically nonregenerative tissues. Identification of key molecules involved in regeneration can broaden our understanding of the wound-healing process and generate novel therapeutic approaches. Tissue profiling by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry is a rapid, powerful proteomic tool that allows hundreds of proteins to be detected from specific regions of intact tissue specimens. To identify these candidate molecules, protein expression in ear punches was examined after 4 and 7 days using tissue profiling of MRL/MpJ-Fas(lpr) mice and the nonregenerative mouse strain C57BL/6J. Spectral analysis revealed distinct proteomic differences between the regenerative and nonregenerative phenotypes, including the calcium-binding proteins calgranulin A and B, calgizzarin, and calmodulin. Spatial distributions for these differentially expressed proteins within the injured regions were confirmed by immunohistochemistry.

AB  - Meningiomas are among the most frequent tumors of the brain and spinal cord accounting for 15-20% of all central nervous system tumors and frequently associated with neurofibromatosis type 2. In this study, we aimed to unravel molecular meningioma tumorigenesis and discover novel protein biomarkers for diagnostic and/or prognostic purposes and performed in-depth proteomic profiling of meningioma cells compared to human primary arachnoidal cells. We isolated proteins from meningioma cell line SF4433 and human primary arachnoidal cells and analyzed the protein profiles by Gel-nanoLC-MS/MS in conjunction with protein identification and quantification by shotgun nanoLC tandem mass spectrometry and spectral counting. Differential analysis of meningiomas revealed changes in the expression levels of 281 proteins (P < 0.01) associated with various biological functions such as DNA replication, recombination, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Among several interesting proteins, we focused on a subset of the highly significantly up-regulated proteins, the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) family. We performed subsequent validation studies by qRT-PCR in human meningioma tissue samples (WHO grade I, 14 samples; WHO grade II, 7 samples; and WHO grade III, 7 samples) compared to arachnoidal tissue controls (from fresh autopsies; 3 samples) and found that MCMs are highly and significantly up-regulated in human meningioma tumor samples compared to arachnoidal tissue controls. We found a significant increase in MCM2 (8 fold), MCM3 (5 fold), MCM4 (4 fold), MCM5 (4 fold), MCM6 (3 fold), and MCM7 (5 fold) expressions in meningiomas. This study suggests that MCM family proteins are up-regulated in meningiomas and can be used as diagnostic markers.

AB  - The experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAR) model resembles certain aspects of multiple sclerosis (MScl), with common features such as motor dysfunction, axonal degradation, and infiltration of T-cells. We studied the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome in the EAE rat model to identify proteomic changes relevant for MSd disease pathology. EAE was induced in male Lewis rats by injection of myelin basic protein (MBP) together with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). An inflammatory control group was injected with CFA alone, and a nontreated group served as healthy control. CSF was collected at day 10 and 14 after immunization and analyzed by bottom-up proteomics on Orbitrap LC-MS and QTOF LC-MS platforms in two independent laboratories. By combining results, 44 proteins were discovered to be significantly increased in EAE animals compared to both control groups, 25 of which have not been mentioned in relation to the EAE model before. Lysozyme Cl, fetuin B, T-kininogen, serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1, glutathione peroxidase 3, complement C3, and afamin are among the proteins significantly elevated in this rat EAE model. Two proteins, afamin and complement C3, were validated in an independent sample set using quantitative selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry. The molecular weights of the identified differentially abundant proteins indicated an increased transport across the blood brain barrier (BBB) at the peak of the disease, caused by an increase in BBB permeability.

AB  - Cell therapies represent a promising approach to slow down the progression of currently untreatable neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), as well as to support the reconstruction of functional neural circuits after spinal cord injuries. In such therapies, the grafted cells could either functionally integrate into the damaged tissue, partially replacing dead or damaged cells, modulate inflammatory reaction, reduce tissue damage, or support neuronal survival by secretion of cytokines, growth, and trophic factors. Comprehensive characterization of cells and their proliferative potential, differentiation status, and population purity before transplantation is crucial to preventing safety risks, e.g., a tumorous growth due to the proliferation of undifferentiated stem cells. We characterized changes in the proteome and secretome of human neural stem cells (NSCs) during their spontaneous (EGF/FGF2 withdrawal) differentiation and differentiation with trophic support by BDNF/GDNF supplementation. We used LC-MS/MS in SWATH-MS mode for global cellular proteome profiling and quantified almost three thousand cellular proteins. Our analysis identified substantial protein differences in the early stages of NSC differentiation with more than a third of all the proteins regulated (including known neuronal and NSC multipotency markers) and revealed that the BDNF/GDNF support affected more the later stages of the NSC differentiation. Among the pathways identified as activated during both spontaneous and BDNF/GDNF differentiation were the HIF-1 signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, and VEGF signaling pathway. Our follow-up secretome analysis using Luminex multiplex immunoassay revealed significant changes in the secretion of VEGF and IL-6 during NSC differentiation. Our results further demonstrated an increased expression of neuropilin-1 as well as catenin beta-1, both known to participate in the regulation of VEGF signaling, and showed that VEGF-A isoform 121 (VEGF121), in particular, induces proliferation and supports survival of differentiating cells.

AB  - Olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) are a special type of dial cells that have characteristics of both astrocytes and Schwann cells. Evidence suggests that the regenerative capacity of OECs is induced by soluble, secreted factors that influence their microenvironment These factors may regulate OECs self-renewal and/or induce their capacity to augment spinal cord regeneration Profiling of plasma membrane and extracellular matrix through a high-throughput expression proteomics approach was undertaken to identify plasma membrane and extracellular matrix proteins of OECs under serum-free conditions 1D-shotgun proteomics followed with gene ontology (GO) analysis was used to screen proteins from primary culture rat OECs Four hundred and seventy nonredundant plasma membrane proteins and 168 extracellular matrix proteins were identified, the majority of which were never before reported to be produced by OECs Furthermore. plasma membrane and extracellular proteins were classified based on their protein protein interaction predicted by STRING quantitatively integrates interaction data The proteomic profiling of the OECs plasma membrane proteins and their connection with the secretome in serum-free culture conditions provides new insights into the nature of their in vivo microenvironmental niche Proteomic analysis for the discovery of clinical biomarkers of OECs mechanism warrants further study

AB  - Relevance: Acupuncture is an intrinsic part of traditional Chinese medicine. The current understanding of the acupuncture meridian system, acupoints and the potential utilizing Omics technologies are summarized in this review.
   Material and methods: A systematic search for acupuncture involving Omics technologies was carried out using multiple online literature databases. The records retrieved were from the full collections of each database dated to September 2011. Data produced from functional genomic technologies were extracted from the collected acupuncture/moxibustion studies and subjected to evaluation. Analyses and comments were summarized on the advances in experimental research in acupuncture/moxibustion-related studies, and the future for strategies and approaches in the era of functional genomics highlighted.
   Results: An overview of articles indicated that several diseases or symptoms with evidence of effectiveness had been piloted for using functional genomic technologies, such as Parkinson's disease, allergic disorders, pain, and spinal cord injury, most of which are chronic "difficult diseases". High-throughput genomic and proteomic profiling of gene expression in tissues has been able to identify potential candidates for the effects of acupuncture and provide valuable information toward understanding the possible mechanisms of the therapy. However, without further holistic and sophisticated analyses in the context of metabolomics and systems biology, the current attempts and the foreseeable developments appear to be insufficient to produce firm conclusions. Noticeably, the recent rapid advances in functional molecular imaging targeting specific metabolites have shown great promise and if combined with other post-genomic technologies, could be extremely helpful for the acupuncture studies in human subjects.
   Conclusion: This review suggest that disease-oriented studies using the approach of multi-indexed high-throughput technologies and systems biology analyses will be a preferred strategy for future acupuncture/moxibustion research. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Physical exercise has been reported to increase neurotrophin in brain tissues as hippocampus as well as increased neurotrophic level peripherally in blood plasma and might have an effect on/or affect molecular processes of energy metabolism (and homeostasis). In this study, using quantitative proteomic analysis, we obtained a plasma protein profile from the rat with long-term moderate exercise. A total of 752 proteins were identified in the plasma. Among them, 54 proteins were significant up-regulated and 47 proteins were down-regulated in the plasma of exercise group compared with the control group. Bioinformatic analyses showed that these altered proteins are widely involved in multiple biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components, which connect with 11 signaling pathways. Interestingly, 5 up-regulated proteins Raplb, PTPN11, ARHGDIA, Cdc42 and YWHAE, confirmed by Western blots, are involved in the neurotrophin signaling pathway which shows the lowest P value among the identified pathways. Further analyses showed that the 5 neurotrophin-signaling-pathway-related proteins participate in two important protein-protein interaction networks associated to cell survival and apoptosis, axonal development, synapse formation and plasticity. This study provides an exercise-induced plasma protein profile, suggesting that long-term exercise enhances the proteins involved in neurotrophin signaling pathway which may contribute to health benefit.
   Significance: Physical activity contributes to myriad benefits on body health across the lifespan. The changes in plasma proteins after chronic moderate exercise may be used as biomarkers for health and may also play important roles in increase of cardiovascular fitness, enhancement of immune competence, prevention of obesity, decrease of risk for neurological disorders, cancer, stroke, diabetes and other metabolic disorders. Using a TMT-based proteomic method, this study identified 101 altered proteins in the plasma of rats after long-term moderate treadmill running, which may provide novel biomarkers for further investigation of the underlying mechanism of physical exercise. We confirmed that exercise enhances 5 proteins of the neurotrophin signaling pathway that may contribute to health benefits.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset motor neuron disease in which the loss of spinal cord motor neurons leads to paralysis and death within a few years of clinical disease onset. In almost all cases of ALS, transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) forms cytoplasmic neuronal inclusions. A second causative gene for a subset of ALS is fused in sarcoma, an RNA binding protein that also forms cytoplasmic inclusions in spinal cord motor neurons. Poly-A binding protein-1 (PABP-1) is a marker of stress granules (i.e. accumulations of proteins and RNA indicative of translational arrest in cells under stress). We report on the colocalization of PABP-1 to both TDP-43 and fused-in-sarcoma inclusions in 4 patient cohorts: ALS without a mutation, ALS with an intermediate polyglutamine repeat expansion in ATXN2, ALS with a GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72, and ALS with basophilic inclusion body disease. Notably, PABP-1 colocalization to TDP-43 was twice as frequent in ALS with C9orf72 expansions compared to ALS with no mutation. This study highlights PABP-1 as a protein that is important to the pathology of ALS and indicates that the proteomic profile of TDP-43 inclusions in ALS may differ depending on the causative genetic mutation.

AB  - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease with progressive paralysis of limbs and bulb in patients, the cause of which remains unclear. Accumulating studies suggest that motor neuron degeneration is associated with systemic metabolic impairment in ALS. However, the metabolic reprogramming and underlying mechanism in the longitudinal progression of the disease remain poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to investigate the molecular changes at both metabolic and proteomic levels during disease progression to identify the most critical metabolic pathways and underlying mechanisms involved in ALS pathophysiological changes. Utilizing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, we analyzed the metabolites' levels of plasma, lumbar spinal cord, and motor cortex from SOD1(G93A) mice and wildtype (WT) littermates at different stages. To elucidate the regulatory network underlying metabolic changes, we further analyzed the proteomics profile in the spinal cords of SOD1(G93A) and WT mice. A group of metabolites implicated in purine metabolism, methionine cycle, and glycolysis were found differentially expressed in ALS mice, and abnormal expressions of enzymes involved in these metabolic pathways were also confirmed. Notably, we first demonstrated that dysregulation of purine metabolism might contribute to the pathogenesis and disease progression of ALS. Furthermore, we discovered that fatty acid metabolism, TCA cycle, arginine and proline metabolism, and folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism were also significantly altered in this disease. The identified differential metabolites and proteins in our study could complement existing data on metabolic reprogramming in ALS, which might provide new insight into the pathological mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets of ALS.

AB  - Lead (Pb) is a toxic metal with great neurotoxic potential. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a long-term Pb intoxication on the global proteomic profile, oxidative biochemistry and neuronal density in motor cortex of adult rats, and the possible outcomes related to motor functions. For this, Wistar rats received for 55 days a dose of 50 mg/Kg of Pb acetate by intragastric gavage. Then, the motor abilities were evaluated by open field and inclined plane tests. To investigate the possible oxidative biochemistry modulation, the levels of pro-oxidant parameters as lipid peroxidation and nitrites were evaluated. The global proteomic profile was evaluated by ultraefficiency liquid chromatography system coupled with mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS) followed by bioinformatic analysis. Moreover, it was evaluated the mature neuron density by anti-NeuN immunostaining. The statistical analysis was performed through Student's t-test, considering p<0.05. We observed oxidative stress triggering by the increase in malonaldehyde and nitrite levels in motor cortex. In the proteomic analysis, the motor cortex presented alterations in proteins associated with neural functioning, morphological organization, and neurodegenerative features. In addition, it was observed a decrease in the number of mature neurons. These findings, associated with previous evidences observed in spinal cord, cerebellum, and hippocampus under the same Pb administration protocol, corroborate with the motor deficits in the rats towards Pb. Thus, we conclude that the long-term administration to Pb in young Wistar rats triggers impairments at several organizational levels, such as biochemical and morphological, which resulted in poor motor performance.

AB  - In this review. we highlight recent findings about the role of some mitochondrial proteins in neurological diseases. Studies in mice gene-deleted for Omi/HtrA2 and AIF showed the involvement of these mitochondrial proteins in, selective cell degeneration in the spinal cord and brain. In humans, mutations in the mitochondrial protein, Paraplegin, cause an autosomal form of hereditary spastic paraplegia with an enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress. Reactive oxygen species and decreased respiratory chain activity in mitochondria also contribute to common neurological diseases. The mitochondrial uncoupling protein, Ucp-2, was found to be neuroprotective in experimental stroke and brain trauma. Recent proteomic and profiling studies have revealed the existence of additional mitochondrial proteins with unknown functions. The elucidation of the physiological functions of mitochondrial proteins may lead to new insights into the role of these organelles in cell degeneration and to identification of novel drug targets for the prevention and treatment of different diseases.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents one of the major public health concerns worldwide due to the increase in TBI incidence as a result of injuries from daily life accidents such as sports and motor vehicle transportation as well as military-related practices. This type of central nervous system trauma is known to predispose patients to several neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, chronic trauamatic encephalopathy, and age-related Dementia. Recently, several proteomic and lipidomic platforms have been applied on different TBI studies to investigate TBI-related mechanisms that have broadened our understanding of its distinct neuropathological complications. In this study, we provide an updated comprehensive overview of the current knowledge and novel perspectives of the spatially resolved microproteomics and microlipidomics approaches guided by mass spectrometry imaging used in TBI studies and its applications in the neurotrauma field. In this regard, we will discuss the use of the spatially resolved microproteomics and assess the different microproteomic sampling methods such as laser capture microdissection, parafilm assisted microdissection, and liquid microjunction extraction as accurate and precise techniques in the field of neuroproteomics. Additionally, we will highlight lipid profiling applications and their prospective potentials in characterizing molecular processes involved in the field of TBI. Specifically, we will discuss the phospholipid metabolism acting as a precursor for proinflammatory molecules such as eicosanoids. Finally, we will survey the current state of spatial neuroproteomics and microproteomics applications and present the various studies highlighting their findings in these fields.

AB  - Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an unstable GAA repeat expansion within intron 1 of the FXN gene and characterized by peripheral neuropathy. A major feature of FRDA is frataxin deficiency with the loss of large sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), namely proprioceptive neurons, undergoing dying-back neurodegeneration with progression to posterior columns of the spinal cord and cerebellar ataxia. We used isolated DRGs from a YG8R FRDA mouse model and C57BL/6J control mice for a proteomic study and a primary culture of sensory neurons from DRG to test novel pharmacological strategies. We found a decreased expression of electron transport chain (ETC) proteins, the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system and antioxidant enzymes, confirming a clear impairment in mitochondrial function and an oxidative stress-prone phenotype. The proteomic profile also showed a decreased expression in Ca2+ signaling related proteins and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors modulate intracellular cAMP/cGMP and Ca2+ levels. Treatment of frataxin-deficient sensory neurons with phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors was able to restore improper cytosolic Ca2+ levels and revert the axonal dystrophy found in DRG neurons of YG8R mice. In conclusion, the present study shows the effectiveness of PDE inhibitors against axonal degeneration of sensory neurons in YG8R mice. Our findings indicate that PDE inhibitors may become a future FRDA pharmacological treatment.

AB  - To identify candidate serum molecule biomarkers for the non-invasive early prenatal diagnosis of neural tube defects (NTDs), we employed an iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomic approach to analyze the proteomic changes in serum samples from embryonic day (E) 11 and E13 pregnant rats with spina bifida aperta (SBA) induced by all-trans retinoic acid. Among the 390 proteins identified, 40 proteins at E11 and 26 proteins at E13 displayed significant differential expression in the SBA groups. We confirmed 5 candidate proteins by ELISA. We observed the space-time expression changes of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) at different stages of fetal development, including a marked decrease in the sera of NTD pregnancies and gradual increase in the sera of normal pregnancies with embryonic development. PCSK9 demonstrated the diagnostic efficacy of potential NTD biomarkers [with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.763, 95% CI: 065-0.88]. Additionally, PCSK9 expression in the spinal cords and placentas of SBA rat fetuses was markedly decreased. PCSK9 could serve as a novel molecular biomarker for the non-invasive prenatal screening of NTDs and may be involved in the pathogenesis of NTDs at critical periods of fetal development.

AB  - UBQLN2 mutations cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but the pathogenic mechanisms by which they cause disease remain unclear. Proteomic profiling identified 'mitochondrial proteins' as comprising the largest category of protein changes in the spinal cord (SC) of the P497S UBQLN2 mouse model of ALS/FTD. Immunoblots confirmed P497S animals have global changes in proteins predictive of a severe decline in mitochondrial health, including oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), mitochondrial protein import and network dynamics. Functional studies confirmed mitochondria purified from the SC of P497S animals have age-dependent decline in nearly all steps of OXPHOS. Mitochondria cristae deformities were evident in spinal motor neurons of aged P497S animals. Knockout (KO) of UBQLN2 in HeLa cells resulted in changes in mitochondrial proteins and OXPHOS activity similar to those seen in the SC. KO of UBQLN2 also compromised targeting and processing of the mitochondrial import factor, TIMM44, resulting in accumulation in abnormal foci. The functional OXPHOS deficits and TIMM44-targeting defects were rescued by reexpression of WT UBQLN2 but not by ALS/FTD mutant UBQLN2 proteins. In vitro binding assays revealed ALS/FTD mutant UBQLN2 proteins bind weaker with TIMM44 than WT UBQLN2 protein, suggesting that the loss of UBQLN2 binding may underlie the import and/or delivery defect of TIMM44 to mitochondria. Our studies indicate a potential key pathogenic disturbance in mitochondrial health caused by UBQLN2 mutations.

AB  - Decellularized peripheral nerve has been proven to be an effective clinical intervention for peripheral nerve repair and a preclinical cell carrier after spinal cord injury. However, there are currently a lack of decellularization methods for peripheral nerve that remove cells and maintain matrix similar to the previously established, clinically translated technique (the Hudson method) that relies on the discontinued Triton X-200 detergent. Therefore, the aim of this study was to optimize a novel chemical decellularization method for peripheral nerves based on the currently available anionic detergent sodium deoxycholate. Sprague Dawley rat sciatic nerves were isolated, frozen in buffered solution, and then subject to sequential washes in water, salt buffer, zwitterionic detergents sulfobetaines -10 and -16, and varying concentrations of sodium deoxycholate (SDC). To optimize DNA removal after SDC decellularization, nerves were subjected to deoxyribonuclease (DNase) incubation and salt buffer washes. Immunohistochemical results demonstrated that utilization of 3% SDC in the decellularization process preserved extracellular matrix (ECM) components and structure while facilitating significantly better removal of Schwann cells, axons, and myelin compared with the Hudson method. The addition of a 3-h DNase incubation to the 3% SDC decellularization process significantly removed cellular debris compared with the Hudson method. Proteomic analysis demonstrated that our novel decellularization method based on 3% SDC +3-h DNase used in conjunction with zwitterionic detergents, and salt buffers (new decellularization method using 3% SDC + 3-h DNase, zwitterionic detergents, and salt buffers [SDD method]) produced a similar proteomic profile compared with the Hudson method and had significantly fewer counts of cellular proteins. Finally, cytotoxicity analysis demonstrated that the SDD decellularized scaffolds do not contain significant cytotoxic residuals as eluted media supported metabolically active Schwann cells in vitro. Overall, this study demonstrates that SDD decellularization represents a novel alternative utilizing currently commercially available chemical reagents. Impact Statement Decellularized nerves are clinically relevant materials that can be used for a variety of regenerative applications such as peripheral nerve and spinal cord injury repair. However, discontinuation of key detergents used in a proven chemical decellularization process necessitates the optimization of an equivalent or better method. This research presents the field with a novel chemical decellularization method to replace the previous validated standard. Scaffolds generated from this method provide an extracellular matrix-rich material that can be used in a variety of in vitro applications to understand cellular behavior and in vivo applications to facilitate regeneration after neural injury.

AB  - Treatments for chronic pain are inadequate, and new options are needed. Nonpharmaceutical approaches are especially attractive with many potential advantages including safety. Light therapy has been suggested to be beneficial in certain medical conditions such as depression, but this approach remains to be explored for modulation of pain. We investigated the effects of light-emitting diodes (LEDs), in the visible spectrum, on acute sensory thresholds in naive rats as well as in experimental neuropathic pain. Rats receiving green LED light (wavelength 525 nm, 8 h/d) showed significantly increased paw withdrawal latency to a noxious thermal stimulus; this antinociceptive effect persisted for 4 days after termination of last exposure without development of tolerance. No apparent side effects were noted and motor performance was not impaired. Despite LED exposure, opaque contact lenses prevented antinociception. Rats fitted with green contact lenses exposed to room light exhibited antinociception arguing for a role of the visual system. Antinociception was not due to stress/anxiety but likely due to increased enkephalins expression in the spinal cord. Naloxone reversed the antinociception, suggesting involvement of central opioid circuits. Rostral ventromedial medulla inactivation prevented expression of light-induced antinociception suggesting engagement of descending inhibition. Green LED exposure also reversed thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia in rats with spinal nerve ligation. Pharmacological and proteomic profiling of dorsal root ganglion neurons from green LED-exposed rats identified changes in calcium channel activity, including a decrease in the N-type (CaV2.2) channel, a primary analgesic target. Thus, green LED therapy may represent a novel, nonpharmacological approach for managing pain.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in mitochondrial dysfunction and induction of lipid peroxidation (LP). Lipid peroxidation-derived neurotoxic aldehydes such as 4-HNE and acrolein bind to mitochondrial proteins, inducing additional oxidative damage and further exacerbating mitochondrial dysfunction and LP. Mitochondria are heterogeneous, consisting of both synaptic and non-synaptic populations. Synaptic mitochondria are reported to be more vulnerable to injury; however, this is the first study to characterize the temporal profile of synaptic and non-synaptic mitochondria following TBI, including investigation of respiratory dysfunction and oxidative damage to mitochondria! proteins between 3 and 120 h following injury. These results indicate that synaptic mitochondria are indeed the more vulnerable population, showing both more rapid and severe impairments than non-synaptic mitochondria. By 24 h, synaptic respiration is significantly impaired compared to synaptic sham, whereas non-synaptic respiration does not decline significantly until 48 h. Decreases in respiration are associated with increases in oxidative damage to synaptic and non-synaptic mitochondria! proteins at 48 h and 72 h, respectively. These results indicate that the therapeutic window for mitochondria-targeted pharmacological neuroprotectants to prevent respiratory dysfunction is shorter for the more vulnerable synaptic mitochondria than for the non-synaptic population.

AB  - Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS) is characterized by MRI-typical brain lesions fulfilling the 2009 Okuda criteria, detected in patients without clinical conditions suggestive of MS. Half of all RIS patients convert to MS within 10 years. The individual course of the disease, however, is highly variable with 12% of RIS converting directly to progressive MS. Demographic and imaging markers have been associated with the risk of clinical MS in RIS: male sex, younger age, infra-tentorial, and spinal cord lesions on the index scan and gadolinium-enhancing lesions on index or follow-up scans. Although not considered as a distinct MS phenotype, RIS certainly shares common pathological features with early active and progressive MS. In this review, we specifically focus on biological markers that may help refine the risk stratification of clinical MS and disability for early treatment. Intrathecal B-cell activation with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) oligoclonal bands, elevated kappa free light chains, and cytokine production is specific to MS, whereas neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels reflect disease activity associated with neuroaxonal injury. Specific microRNA profiles have been identified in RIS converters in both CSF and blood. CSF levels of chitinases and glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP) reflecting astrogliosis might help predict the evolution of RIS to progressive MS. Innovative genomic, proteomic, and metabolomic approaches have provided several new candidate biomarkers to be explored in RIS. Leveraging data from randomized controlled trials and large prospective RIS cohorts with extended follow-up to identify, as early as possible, biomarkers for predicting greater disease severity would be invaluable for counseling patients, managing treatment, and monitoring.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive dysfunction of the nervous system as a result of neuronal loss in the brain and spinal cord. Despite extensive research efforts aimed at development of new disease-modifying therapeutics, there is still no effective treatment to halt neurodegenerative processes. Thus, modification of current therapeutic and diagnostic research strategies is a goal of increasing urgency. The biggest limitation in neurodegenerative disease research is the lack of appropriate biomarkers. Discovery of universal biomarkers capable of diagnosing patients with neurodegenerative diseases, monitoring their response to therapy, and predicting disease progression seems to be a tall order. Instead, a combination of different methodologies in the discovery of biomarkers specific for each described aspect of the disease seems to be a more viable approach. Although application of personalized medicine in diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases may seem far off, some recent developments, such as utilizing specific biological therapies in multiple sclerosis, microRNA profiling as a source of novel biomarkers in Parkinson's disease, or combination of neuroimaging and proteomic analyses in diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease patients, already point to the way clinical neurology may integrate new achievements in everyday practice. Combination of genomic, proteomic, glycomic, and metabolomic approaches may yield novel insights into molecular mechanisms of disease pathophysiology, which could then be integrated and translated into clinical neurology. Based on the developments during the past decade, it is feasible to predict that a personalized approach to treating neurological disorders will become more widely applicable in the coming years.

AB  - Repeated exposures to addictive drugs result in persistent or even permanent expression changes of proteins in addiction-related brain regions, such as nucleus accumbens, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex while the changes of protein content in amygdala were seldom studied. Here we aimed to find the proteins involved in the process of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). The model of morphine-induced CPP was established in rats and the rat amygdala tissues were obtained in different stages of morphine-induced CPP: establishment group, extinction group, reinstatement group and saline group as a control. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) was performed to analyze and compare the changes of protein expression profiles in the amygdala of rats during the process of morphine-induced CPP. There were eighty proteins with 1.3-fold changes in amygdala relative to saline group, most of which were down-regulated. These differentially expressed proteins were mainly involved in metabolism, structure, cell signaling pathway and ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. And we further used methods of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting to confirm the results of proteomics. Mitosis activated protein kinase1 (MAPK1) was increased in the stages of extinction and reinstatement of morphine-induced CPP, while glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was decreased in the stage of extinction. Our results provide some proteins and cellular signaling pathways involved in the molecular mechanisms of opioid addiction in amygdala. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: While plasma biomarkers have been proposed to aid in the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), few biomarkers have been validated in independent patient cohorts. Here we aim to determine plasma biomarkers associated with AD in 2 independent cohorts and validate the findings in the multicenter Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).
   Methods: Using a targeted proteomic approach, we measured levels of 190 plasma proteins and peptides in 600 participants from 2 independent centers (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia; Washington University, St. Louis, MO), and identified 17 analytes associated with the diagnosis of very mild dementia/mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. Four analytes (apoE, B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, pancreatic polypeptide) were also found to be altered in clinical MCI/AD in the ADNI cohort (n = 566). Regression analysis showed CSF A beta 42 levels and t-tau/A beta 42 ratios to correlate with the number of APOE4 alleles and plasma levels of B-type natriuretic peptide and pancreatic polypeptide.
   Conclusion: Four plasma analytes were consistently associated with the diagnosis of very mild dementia/MCI/AD in 3 independent clinical cohorts. These plasma biomarkers may predict underlying AD through their association with CSF AD biomarkers, and the association between plasma and CSF amyloid biomarkers needs to be confirmed in a prospective study.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common neurodegenerative disease and the first cause of dementia worldwide, has no effective treatment, and its pathological mechanisms are not yet fully understood. We conducted this study to explore the proteomic differences associated with Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD) in olfactory ecto-mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) derived from PSEN1 (A431E) mutation carriers compared with healthy donors paired by age and gender through two label-free liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approaches. The first analysis compared carrier 1 (patient with symptoms, P1) and its control (healthy donor, C1), and the second compared carrier 2 (patient with pre-symptoms, P2) with its respective control cells (C2) to evaluate whether the protein alterations presented in the symptomatic carrier were also present in the pre-symptom stages. Finally, we analyzed the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) for biological and functional enrichment. These proteins showed impaired expression in a stage-dependent manner and are involved in energy metabolism, vesicle transport, actin cytoskeleton, cell proliferation, and proteostasis pathways, in line with previous AD reports. Our study is the first to conduct a proteomic analysis of MSCs from the Jalisco FAD patients in two stages of the disease (symptomatic and presymptomatic), showing these cells as a new and excellent in vitro model for future AD studies.

AB  - Introduction: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and aging are associated with platelet hyperactivity. However, the mechanisms underlying abnormal platelet function in AD and aging are yet poorly understood.Methods: To explore the molecular profile of AD and aged platelets, we investigated platelet activation (i.e., CD62P expression), proteome and transcriptome in AD patients, non-demented elderly, and young individuals as controls.Results: AD, aged and young individuals showed similar levels of platelet activation based on CD62P expression. However, AD and aged individuals had a proteomic signature suggestive of increased platelet activation compared with young controls. Transcriptomic profiling suggested the dysregulation of proteolytic machinery involved in regulating platelet function, particularly the ubiquitin-proteasome system in AD and autophagy in aging. The functional implication of these transcriptomic alterations remains unclear and requires further investigation.Discussion: Our data strengthen the evidence of enhanced platelet activation in aging and provide a first glimpse of the platelet transcriptomic changes occurring in AD.

AB  - The lack of biomarkers for early diagnosis, clinical stratification and to monitor treatment response has hampered the development of new therapies for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a clinically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with a variable site of disease initiation and rate of progression. To identify new biomarkers and therapeutic targets, two separate proteomic workflows were applied to study the immunological response and the plasma/brain proteome in phenotypic variants of ALS. Conventional multiplex (TMT) proteomic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was performed alongside a recently introduced method to profile neuronal-derived proteins in plasma using brain tissue-enhanced isobaric tagging (TMTcalibrator). The combined proteomic analysis allowed the detection of regulated proteins linked to ALS pathogenesis (RNA-binding protein FUS, superoxide dismutase Cu-Zn and neurofilaments light polypeptide) alongside newly identified candidate biomarkers (myosin-9, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and plectin). In line with the proteomic results, orthogonal immunodetection showed changes in neurofilaments and ApoE in bulbar versus limb onset fast progressing ALS. Functional analysis of significantly regulated features showed enrichment of pathways involved in regulation of the immune response, Rho family GTPases, semaphorin and integrin signalling. Our cross-phenotype investigation of PBMCs and plasma/brain proteins provides a more sensitive biomarker exploratory platform than conventional case-control studies in a single matrix. The reported regulated proteins may represent novel biomarker candidates and potentially druggable targets.

AB  - Peripheral sensory and motor nerves have different functions and different approaches to regeneration, especially their distinct ability to accurately reinervate terminal nerve pathways. To understand the molecular aspects underlying these differences, the proteomics technique by coupling isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) with online two-dimensional liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (2D LC-MS/MS) was used to investigate the protein profile of sensory and motor nerve samples from rats. A total of 1472 proteins were identified in either sensory or motor nerve. Of them, 100 proteins showed differential expressions between both nerves, and some of them were validated by quantitative real time RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. In the light of functional categorization, the differentially expressed proteins in sensory and motor nerves, belonging to a broad range of classes, were related to a diverse array of biological functions, which included cell adhesion, cytoskeleton, neuronal plasticity, neurotrophic activity, calcium-binding, signal transduction, transport, enzyme catalysis, lipid metabolism, DNA-binding, synaptosome function, actin-binding, ATP-binding, extracellular matrix, and commitment to other lineages. The relatively higher expressed proteins in either sensory or motor nerve were tentatively discussed in combination with their specific molecular characteristics. It is anticipated that the database generated in this study will provide a solid foundation for further comprehensive investigation of functional differences between sensory and motor nerves, including the specificity of their regeneration.

AB  - Axons in the peripheral nervous system have the ability to repair themselves after damage, whereas axons in the central nervous system are unable to do so. A common and important characteristic of damage to the spinal cord, brain, and peripheral nerves is the disruption of axonal regrowth. Interestingly, intrinsic growth factors play a significant role in the axonal regeneration of injured nerves. Various factors such as proteomic profile, microtubule stability, ribosomal location, and signalling pathways mark a line between the central and peripheral axons' capacity for self-renewal. Unfortunately, glial scar development, myelin-associated inhibitor molecules, lack of neurotrophic factors, and inflammatory reactions are among the factors that restrict axonal regeneration. Molecular pathways such as cAMP, MAPK, JAK/STAT, ATF3/CREB, BMP/SMAD, AKT/mTORC1/p70S6K, PI3K/AKT, GSK-3 beta/CLASP, BDNF/Trk, Ras/ERK, integrin/FAK, RhoA/ROCK/LIMK, and POSTN/integrin are activated after nerve injury and are considered significant players in axonal regeneration. In addition to the aforementioned pathways, growth factors, microRNAs, and astrocytes are also commendable participants in regeneration. In this review, we discuss the detailed mechanism of each pathway along with key players that can be potentially valuable targets to help achieve quick axonal healing. We also identify the prospective targets that could help close knowledge gaps in the molecular pathways underlying regeneration and shed light on the creation of more powerful strategies to encourage axonal regeneration after nervous system injury.

AB  - Background: TDP-43 proteinopathy is a pathological hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). So far, there is no therapy available for these neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, the impact of TDP-43 proteinopathy on neuronal translational profile also remains unknown.
   Methods: Biochemical, immunohistology and assay-based studies were done with cell cultures and transgenic mice models. We also used Ribotag with microarray and proteomic analysis to determine the neuronal translational profile in the mice model of ALS/FTD.
   Results: Here, we report that oral administration of a novel analog (IMS-088) of withaferin-A, an antagonist of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-B) essential modulator (NEMO), induced autophagy and reduced TDP-43 proteinopathy in the brain and spinal cord of transgenic mice expressing human TDP-43 mutants, models of ALS/FTD. Treatment with IMS-088 ameliorated cognitive impairment, reduced gliosis in the brain of ALS/FTD mouse models. With the Ribotrap method, we investigated the impact of TDP-43 proteinopathy and IMS-088 treatment on the translation profile of neurons of one-year old hTDP-43(A315T) mice. TDP-43 proteinopathy caused translational dysregulation of specific mRNAs including translational suppression of neurofilament mRNAs resulting in 3 to 4-fold decrease in levels type IV neurofilament proteins. Oral administration of IMS-088 rescued the translational defects associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy and restored the synthesis of neurofilament proteins, which are essential for axon integrity and synaptic function.
   Conclusions: Our study revealed that induction of autophagy reduces TDP-43 pathology and ameliorates the translational defect seen in mice models of ALS/FTD. Based on these results, we suggest IMS-088 and perhaps other inducers of autophagy should be considered as potential therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders with TDP-43 proteinopathies.

AB  - The three tandem-arrayed protocadherin (Pcdh) gene clusters, namely Pcdh-alpha, Pcdh-beta, and Pcdh-gamma, play important roles in the development of the vertebrate central nervous system. To gain insight into the molecular action of PCDHs, we performed a systematic proteomics analysis of PCDH-gamma-associated protein complexes. We identified a list of 154 non-redundant proteins in the PCDH-gamma complexes. This list includes nearly 30 members of clustered Pcdh-alpha, -beta, and -gamma families as core components of the complexes and additionally over 120 putative PCDH-associated proteins. We validated a selected subset of PCDH-gamma-associated proteins using specific antibodies. Analysis of the identities of PCDH-associated proteins showed that the majority of them overlap with the proteomic profile of postsynaptic density preparations. Further analysis of membrane protein complexes revealed that several validated PCDH-gamma-associated proteins exhibit reduced levels in Pcdh-gamma-deficient brain tissues. Therefore, PCDH-gamma s are required for the integrity of the complexes. However, the size of the overall complexes and the abundance of many other proteins remained unchanged, raising a possibility that PCDH-alpha s and PCDH-beta s might compensate for PCDH-gamma function in complex formation. As a test of this idea, RNA interference knockdown of both PCDH-alpha s and PCDH-gamma s showed that PCDHs have redundant functions in regulating neuronal survival in the chicken spinal cord. Taken together, our data provide evidence that clustered PCDHs coexist in large protein complexes and have overlapping functions during vertebrate neural development.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly, is characterized by selective loss of dopaminergic neurons and accumulation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn), mitochondrial dysfunction, Ca2+ dyshomeostasis, and neuroinflammation. Since current treatments for PD merely address symptoms, there is an urgent need to identify the PD pathophysiological mechanisms to develop better therapies. Increasing evidence has identified K(V)3.4, a ROS-sensitive K-V channel carrying fast-inactivating currents, as a potential therapeutic target against neurodegeneration. In fact, it has been hypothesized that K(V)3.4 channels could play a role in PD etiopathogenesis, controlling astrocytic activation and detrimental pathways in A53T mice, a well-known model of familial PD. Here, we showed that the A53T midbrain, primarily involved in the initial phase of PD pathogenesis, displayed an early upregulation of the K(V)3.4 channel at 4 months, followed by its reduction at 12 months, compared with age-matched WT. On the other hand, in the A53T striatum, the expression of K(V)3.4 remained high at 12 months, decreasing thereafter, in 16-month-old mice. The proteomic profile highlighted a different detrimental phenotype in A53T brain areas. In fact, the A53T striatum and midbrain differently expressed neuroprotective/detrimental pathways, with the variation of astrocytic p27(kip1), XIAP, and Smac/DIABLO expression. Of note, a switch from protective to detrimental phenotype was characterized by the upregulation of Smac/DIABLO and downregulation of p27(kip1) and XIAP. This occurred earlier in the A53T midbrain, at 12 months, compared with the striatum proteomic profile. In accordance, an upregulation of Smac/DIABLO and a downregulation of p27(kip1) occurred in the A53T striatum only at 16 months, showing the slowest involvement of this brain area. Of interest, HIF-1 alpha overexpression was associated with the detrimental profile in midbrain and its major vulnerability. At the cellular level, patch-clamp recordings revealed that primary A53T striatum astrocytes showed hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials and lower firing frequency associated with K(V)3.4 ROS-dependent hyperactivity, whereas primary A53T midbrain astrocytes displayed a depolarized resting membrane potential accompanied by a slight increase of K(V)3.4 currents. Accordingly, intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis was significantly altered in A53T midbrain astrocytes, in which the ER Ca2+ level was lower than in A53T striatum astrocytes and the respective littermate controls. Collectively, these results suggest that the early K(V)3.4 overexpression and ROS-dependent hyperactivation in astrocytes could take part in the different vulnerabilities of midbrain and striatum, highlighting astrocytic K(V)3.4 as a possible new therapeutic target in PD.

AB  - One of the major reasons why central nervous system (CNS)-drug development has been challenging in the past, is the barriers that prevent substances entering from the blood circulation into the brain. These barriers include the blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB), blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB), and blood-arachnoid barrier (BAB), and they differ from each other in their transporter protein expression and function as well as among the species. The quantitative expression profiles of the transporters in the CNS-barriers have been recently revealed, and in this review, it is described how they affect the pharmacokinetics of compounds and how these expression differences can be taken into account in the prediction of brain drug disposition in humans, an approach called pharmacoproteomics. In recent years, also structural biology and computational resources have progressed remarkably, enabling a detailed understanding of the dynamic processes of transporters. Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) are currently used commonly to reveal the conformational changes of the transporters and to find the interactions between the substrates and the protein during the binding, translocation in the transporter cavity, and release of the substrate on the other side of the membrane. The computational advancements have also aided in the rational design of transporter-utilizing compounds, including prodrugs that can be actively transported without losing potency towards the pharmacological target. In this review, the state-of-art of these approaches will be also discussed to give insights into the transporter-mediated drug delivery to the CNS.

AB  - In recent years it has been shown that the therapeutic benefits of human mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hMSCs) in the Central Nervous System (CNS) are mainly attributed to their secretome. The implementation of computer-controlled suspension bioreactors has shown to be a viable route for the expansion of these cells to large numbers. As hMSCs actively respond to their culture environment, there is the hypothesis that one can modulate its secretome through their use. Herein, we present data indicating that the use of computer-controlled suspension bioreactors enhanced the neuroregulatory profile of hMSCs secretome. Indeed, higher levels of in vitro neuronal differentiation and NOTCH1 expression in human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) were observed when these cells were incubated with the secretome of dynamically cultured hMSCs. A similar trend was also observed in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) of rat brains where, upon injection, an enhanced neuronal and astrocytic survival and differentiation, was observed. Proteomic analysis also revealed that the dynamic culturing of hMSCs increased the secretion of several neuroregulatory molecules and miRNAs present in hMSCs secretome. In summary, the appropriate use of dynamic culture conditions can represent an important asset for the development of future neuro-regenerative strategies involving the use of hMSCs secretome.

AB  - Increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases has been envisaged for air pollution exposure. On the other hand, environmental risk factors, including air pollution, have been suggested for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) pathomechanism. Therefore, the neurotoxicity of ultrafine particulate matter (PM0.1) (PM < 0.1 mu m size) and its sub-20 nm nanoparticle fraction (NP20) has been investigated in motor neuronal-like cells and primary cortical neurons, mainly affected in ALS. The present data showed that PM0.1 and NP20 exposure induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, as occurred in cortex and spinal cord of ALS mice carrying G93A mutation in SOD1 gene. Furthermore, NSC-34 motor neuronal-like cells exposed to PM0.1 and NP20 shared the same proteomic profile on some apoptotic factors with motor neurons treated with the L-BMAA, a neurotoxin inducing Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis/Parkinson-Dementia Complex (ALS/PDC). Of note ER stress induced by PM0.1 and NP20 in motor neurons was associated to pathological changes in ER morphology and dramatic reduction of organellar Ca2+ level through the dysregulation of the Ca2+-pumps SERCA2 and SERCA3, the Ca2+-sensor STIM1, and the Ca2+-release channels RyR3 and IP3R3. Furthermore, the mechanism deputed to ER Ca2+ refilling (e.g. the so called store operated calcium entry-SOCE) and the relative currents ICRAC were also altered by PM0.1 and NP20 exposure. Additionally, these carbonaceous particles caused the exacerbation of L-BMAA-induced ER stress and Caspase-9 activation. In conclusion, this study shows that PM0.1 and NP20 induced the aberrant expression of ER proteins leading to dysmorphic ER, organellar Ca2+ dysfunction, ER stress and neurotoxicity, providing putative correlations with the neurodegenerative process occurring in ALS.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and within them adipose tissue derived stem cells (ASCs), have been shown to have therapeutic effects on central nervous system (CNS) cell populations. Such effects have been mostly attributed to soluble factors, as well as vesicles, present in their secretome. Yet, little is known about the impact that MSC passaging might have in the secretion therapeutic profile. Our aim was to show how human ASCs (hASCs) passage number influences the effect of their secretome in neuronal survival, differentiation and axonal growth. For this purpose, post-natal rat hippocampal primary cultures, human neural progenitor cell (hNPCs) cultures and dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) explants were incubated with secretome, collected as conditioned media (CM), obtained from hASCs in P3, P6, P9 and P12. Results showed no differences when comparing percentages of MAP-2 positive cells (a mature neuronal marker) in neuronal cultures or hNPCs, after incubation with hASCs secretome from different passages. The same was observed regarding DRG neurite outgrowth. In order to characterize the secretomes obtained from different passages, a proteomic analysis was performed, revealing that its composition did not vary significantly with passage number P3 to P12. Results allowed us to identify several key proteins, such as pigment epithelium derived factor (PEDF), DJ-1, interleucin-6 (IL-6) and galectin, all of which have already proven to play neuroprotective and neurodifferentiating roles. Proteins that promote neurite outgrowth were also found present, such as semaphorin 7A and glypican-1. We conclude that cellular passaging does not influence significantly hASCs's secretome properties especially their ability to support post-natal neuronal survival, induce neurodifferentiation and promote axonal growth.

AB  - Despite the common occurrence and frequent clinical effects of peritumoral cysts in the central nervous system (CNS), the mechanism underlying their development and evolution is not understood. Because they commonly produce peritumoral cysts and because serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is obtained in von Hippel-Lindau disease patients, hemangioblastomas provide an opportunity to examine the pathophysiology of CNS peritumoral cyst formation. Serial MRI was correlated with the clinical findings in 16 von Hippel-Lindau disease patients with 22 CNS hemangioblastomas (11 spinal cord; 11 cerebellar) that were associated with the appearance and evolution of peritumoral cysts. Hemangioblastoma-associated cyst wall histomorphological analysis was performed on postmortem tissues from three von Hippel-Lindau disease patients (not in the clinical series). Comparative proteomic profiling was performed on peritumoral cyst fluid and serum. Vascular endothelial growth factor levels were determined in peritumoral cysts. MRI dearly showed peritumoral edema that developed and slowly and progressively evolved into enlarging hemangioblastoma-associated cysts in all tumors (mean follow-up, 130 +/- 38 months; mean +/- standard deviation). Postcontrast MRI demonstrated convective leakage of gadolinium into cysts. Mean time required for edema to evolve into a cyst was 36 +/- 23 months (range, 8-72 months). Thirteen (59%) hemangioblastoma-cysts became symptomatic (mean time to symptom formation after cyst development, 35 +/- 32 months; range, 3-102 months) and required resection. Protein profiles of cyst fluid and serum were similar. Mean cyst fluid vascular endothelial growth factor concentration was 1.5ng/ml (range, 0-5.4ng/ml). Histology of the cyst walls was consistent with reactive gliosis. CNS peritumoral cyst formation is initiated by increased tumor vascular permeability, increased interstitial pressure in the tumor, and plasma extravasation with convective distribution into the surrounding tissue. When the delivery of plasma from the tumor exceeds the capacity of the surrounding tissue to absorb the extravasated fluid, edema (with its associated increased interstitial pressure) and subsequent cyst formation occur.

AB  - Salamanders completely regenerate their limbs after amputation. Thus, these animals are unique models to investigate the mechanisms modulating regeneration in vertebrates. To investigate the influence of microRNAs (miRNAs) on newt limb regeneration, the miRNAs and mRNAs were simultaneously profiled using Illumina HiSeq 2500 System during limb regeneration of Cynops orientalis at 3, 7, 14, 30 and 42 days postamputation. A total of 203 miRNAs and 4230 mRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed. Together with the proteomic data obtained from our previous study, integrative analysis of multiple profiling data sets was performed to construct an interaction network of differentially expressed miRNAs, mRNAs and proteins. Results of GO and KEGG analyses showed that the differentially expressed miRNA targets were mainly directed to cytoskeletal remodeling and carbohydrate metabolism. The stage-specific regulation of miRNAs on their targets was analyzed by hierarchical clustering analysis and validated by qRT-PCR The negative regulation of miR-223 and miR-133a on their targets was tested by performing dual luciferase reporter assay. The integration analysis will provide a powerful tool to identify the regulatory mechanisms of miRNAs and their targets. The results may have implications in understanding the complex mechanisms underlying newt limb regeneration.

AB  - Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal progressive motor neuron disease, for which there are still no diagnostic/prognostic test and therapy. Specific molecular biomarkers are urgently needed to facilitate clinical studies and speed up the development of effective treatments.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We used a two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis approach to identify in easily accessible clinical samples, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), a panel of protein biomarkers that are closely associated with ALS. Validations and a longitudinal study were performed by immunoassays on a selected number of proteins. The same proteins were also measured in PBMC and spinal cord of a G93A SOD1 transgenic rat model. We identified combinations of protein biomarkers that can distinguish, with high discriminatory power, ALS patients from healthy controls (98%), and from patients with neurological disorders that may resemble ALS (91%), between two levels of disease severity (90%), and a number of translational biomarkers, that link responses between human and animal model. We demonstrated that TDP-43, cyclophilin A and ERp57 associate with disease progression in a longitudinal study. Moreover, the protein profile changes detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of ALS patients are suggestive of possible intracellular pathogenic mechanisms such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, nitrative stress, disturbances in redox regulation and RNA processing.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate that PBMC multiprotein biomarkers could contribute to determine amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diagnosis, differential diagnosis, disease severity and progression, and may help to elucidate pathogenic mechanisms.

AB  - The isolation of neural stem cells from fetal and adult mammalian CNS and the demonstration of functional neurogenesis in adult CNS have offered perspectives for treatment of many devastating hereditary and acquired neurological diseases. Due to this enormous potential, neural stem cells are a subject of extensive molecular profiling studies with a search for new markers and regulatory pathways governing their self-renewal as opposed to differentiation. Several in-depth proteomic studies have been conducted on primary or immortalized cultures of neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells, and yet more remains to be done. Additionally, neurons and glial cells have been obtained from embryonic stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells, and proteins associated with the differentiation process have been characterized to a certain degree with a view to further investigations. This review summarizes recent findings relevant to the proteomics of neural stem cells and discusses major proteins significantly regulated during neural stem cell differentiation with a view to their future use in cell-based regenerative and reparative therapy.

AB  - Brain insults cause rapid cell death, and a disruption of functional circuits, in the affected regions. As the injured tissue recovers from events associated with cell death, regenerative processes are activated that over months lead to a certain degree of functional recovery. Factors produced by new neurons and glia, axonal sprouting of surviving neurons, and new synapse formation help to re-establish some of the lost functions. The timing and location of such events is crucial in the success of the regenerative process. Comprehensive gene expression profiling and proteomic analyses have enabled a deeper molecular and cellular mechanistic understanding of post-injury brain regeneration. These new mechanistic insights are aiding the design of novel therapeutic modalities that enhance regeneration.

AB  - Neural cell death is the main feature of all retinal degenerative disorders that lead to blindness. Despite therapeutic advances, progression of retinal disease cannot always be prevented, and once neuronal cell damage occurs, visual loss cannot be reversed. Recent research in the stem cell field, and the identification of Muller glia with stem cell characteristics in the human eye, have provided hope for the use of these cells in retinal therapies to restore vision. Muller glial cells, which are the major structural cells of the retina, play a very important role in retinal homeostasis during health and disease. They are responsible for the spontaneous retinal regeneration observed in zebrafish and lower vertebrates during early postnatal life, and despite the presence of Muller glia with stem cell characteristics in the adult mammalian retina, there is no evidence that they promote regeneration in humans. Like many other stem cells and neurons derived from pluripotent stem cells, Muller glia with stem cell potential do not differentiate into retinal neurons or integrate into the retina when transplanted into the vitreous of experimental animals with retinal degeneration. However, despite their lack of integration, grafted Muller glia have been shown to induce partial restoration of visual function in spontaneous or induced experimental models of photoreceptor or retinal ganglion cell damage. This improvement in visual function observed after Muller cell transplantation has been ascribed to the release of neuroprotective factors that promote the repair and survival of damaged neurons. Due to the development and availability of pluripotent stem cell lines for therapeutic uses, derivation of Muller cells from retinal organoids formed by iPSC and ESC has provided more realistic prospects for the application of these cells to retinal therapies. Several opportunities for research in the regenerative field have also been unlocked in recent years due to a better understanding of the genomic and proteomic profiles of the developing and regenerating retina in zebrafish, providing the basis for further studies of the human retina. In addition, the increased interest on the nature and function of cellular organelle release and the characterization of molecular components of exosomes released by Muller glia, may help us to design new approaches that could be applied to the development of more effective treatments for retinal degenerative diseases.

AB  - Survivors of poliomyelitis often develop increased or new symptoms decades after the acute infection, a condition known as post-polio syndrome (PPS). The condition affects 20-60% of previous polio patients, making it one of the most common causes of neurological deficits worldwide. The underlying pathogenesis is not fully understood and accurate diagnosis is not feasible. Herein we investigated whether it was possible to identify proteomic profile aberrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of PPS patients.
   CSF from 15 patients with well-defined PPS were analyzed for protein expression profiles. The results were compared to data obtained from nine healthy controls and 34 patients with other non-inflammatory diseases which served as negative controls. In addition, 17 samples from persons with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) were added as relevant age-matched references for the PPS samples.
   The CSF of persons with PPS displayed a disease-specific and highly predictive (P=0.0017) differential expression of five distinct proteins: gelsolin, hemopexin, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, glutathione synthetase and kallikrein 6, respectively, in comparison with the control groups. An independent ELISA confirmed the increase of kallikrein 6.
   We suggest that these five proteins should be further evaluated as candidate biomarkers for the diagnosis and development of new therapies for PPS patients. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several different types of nonneuronal glial cells with diverse phenotypes are present in the CNS, and all have distinct indispensible functions. Although glial cells primarily provide neurons with metabolic and structural support in the healthy brain, they may switch phenotype from a resting to a reactive state in response to pathological insults. Furthermore, this reactive gliosis is an invariant feature of the pathogeneses of CNS maladies. The glial proteome serves as a signature of glial phenotype, and not only executes physiological functions, but also acts as a molecular mediator of the reactive glial phenotype. The glial proteome is also involved in intra- and intercellular communications as exemplified by glia-glia and neuron-glia interactions. The utilization of authoritative proteomic tools and the bioinformatic analyses have helped to profile the brain glial proteome and explore the molecular mechanisms of diverse glial phenotypes. Furthermore, technologic innovations have equipped the field of glioproteomics with refined tools for studies of the expression, interaction, and function of glial proteins in the healthy and in the diseased CNS. Glioproteomics is expected to contribute to the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of CNS pathophysiology and to the discovery of biomarkers and theragnostic targets in CNS disorders.

AB  - While the long-term physiological adaptation of the neuromuscular system to changed functional demands is usually reflected by unilateral skeletal muscle transitions, the progressive degeneration of distinct motor neuron populations is often associated with more complex changes in the abundance and/or isoform expression pattern of contractile proteins and metabolic enzymes. In order to evaluate these intricate effects of primary motor neuronopathy on the skeletal muscle proteome, label-free MS was employed to study global alterations in the WR (wobbler) mouse model of progressive neurodegeneration. In motor neuron disease, fibre-type specification and the metabolic weighting of bioenergetic pathways appear to be strongly influenced by both a differing degree of a subtype-specific vulnerability of neuromuscular synapses and compensatory mechanisms of fibre-type shifting. Proteomic profiling confirmed this pathobiochemical complexity of disease-induced changes and showed distinct alterations in 72 protein species, including a variety of fibre-type-specific isoforms of contractile proteins, metabolic enzymes, metabolite transporters and ion-regulatory proteins, as well as changes in molecular chaperones and various structural proteins. Increases in slow myosin light chains and the troponin complex and a decrease in fast MBP (myosin-binding protein) probably reflect the initial preferential loss of the fast type of neuromuscular synapses in motor neuron disease.

AB  - Background and Objective Despite the success of using photobiomodulation (PBM), also known as low level light therapy, in promoting recovery after central nervous system (CNS) injury, the effect of PBM on microglia, the primary mediators of immune and inflammatory response in the CNS, remains unclear. Microglia exhibit a spectrum of responses to injury, with partial or full polarization into pro- and anti-inflammatory phenotypes. Pro-inflammatory (M1 or classically activated) microglia contribute to chronic inflammation and neuronal toxicity, while anti-inflammatory (M2 or alternatively activated) microglia play a role in wound healing and tissue repair; microglia can fall anywhere along this spectrum in response to stimulation. Materials and Methods The effect of PBM on microglial polarization therefore was investigated using colorimetric assays, immunocytochemistry, proteomic profiling and RT-PCR in vitro after exposure of primary microglia or BV2 microglial cell line to PBM of differing energy densities (0.2, 4, 10, and 30J/cm2, 808nm wavelength, 50mW output power). Results PBM has a dose-dependent effect on the spectrum of microglial M1 and M2 polarization. Specifically, PBM with energy densities between 4 and 30J/cm2 induced expression of M1 markers in microglia. Markers of the M2 phenotype, including CD206 and TIMP1, were observed at lower energy densities of 0.210J/cm2. In addition, co-culture of PBM or control-treated microglia with primary neuronal cultures demonstrated a dose-dependent effect of PBM on microglial-induced neuronal growth and neurite extension. Conclusion These data suggest that the ArndtSchulz law as applied to PBM for a specific bioassay does not hold true in cells with a spectrum of responses, and that PBM can alter microglial phenotype across this spectrum in a dose-dependent manner. These data are therefore of important relevance to not only therapies in the CNS but also to understanding of PBM effects and mechanisms. Lasers Surg. Med. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - As populations age, the number of patients sustaining traumatic brain injury (TBI) and concomitantly receiving preinjury antiplatelet therapy such as aspirin (ASA) and clopidogrel (CLOP) is rising. These drugs have been linked with unfavorable clinical outcomes following TBI, where the exact mechanism(s) involved are still unknown. In this novel work, we aimed to identify and compare the altered proteome profile imposed by ASA and CLOP when administered alone or in combination, prior to experimental TBI. Furthermore, we assessed differential glycosylation PTM patterns following experimental controlled cortical impact model of TBI, ASA, CLOP, and ASA + CLOP. Ipsilateral cortical brain tissues were harvested 48 h postinjury and were analyzed using an advanced neuroproteomics LC-MS/MS platform to assess proteomic and glycoproteins alterations. Of interest, differential proteins pertaining to each group (22 in TBI, 41 in TBI + ASA, 44 in TBI + CLOP, and 34 in TBI + ASA + CLOP) were revealed. Advanced bioinformatics/systems biology and clustering analyses were performed to evaluate biological networks and protein interaction maps illustrating molecular pathways involved in the experimental conditions. Results have indicated that proteins involved in neuroprotective cellular pathways were upregulated in the ASA and CLOP groups when given separately. However, ASA + CLOP administration revealed enrichment in biological pathways relevant to inflammation and proinjury mechanisms. Moreover, results showed differential upregulation of glycoproteins levels in the sialylated N-glycans PTMs that can be implicated in pathological changes. Omics data obtained have provided molecular insights of the underlying mechanisms that can be translated into clinical bedside settings.

AB  - Background: Numerous studies have suggested that an immune system imbalance plays an important role in schizophrenia. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine. It plays multiple roles in various biological processes, including inflammation and neurogenesis. Furthermore, several exhaustive serum proteomic profiling studies have identified MIF as a potential biomarker of schizophrenia. Here, we investigate MIF protein levels in serum and postmortem prefrontal cortex in patients with schizophrenia and controls. Moreover, we investigate the association of two functional polymorphisms in the MIF gene promoter region (MIF-794CATT(5-8) microsatellite and MIF-173G/C single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP]) with schizophrenia.
   Methods: We measured serum MIF levels with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (51 patients vs. 86 controls) and postmortem brain MIF levels with a western blotting assay (18 patients vs. 22 controls). Subsequently, we genotyped the MIF-794CATT(5-8) microsatellite with a fluorescence-based fragment assay and the MIF-173G/C SNP with a TaqMan SNP genotyping assay (1483 patients vs. 1454 controls).
   Results: Serum MIF levels were significantly higher in patients with schizophrenia than in controls (p = 0.00118), and were positively correlated with antipsychotic dose (Spearman's r = 0.222, p = 0.0402). In addition, an earlier age of onset was observed in patients with a high serum MIF level (>= 40 ng/mL) than those with a low serum MIF level (< 40 ng/mL) (p = 0.0392). However, postmortem brain MIF levels did not differ between patients with schizophrenia and controls. The association study revealed that the CATT(6)-G haplotype was nominally significantly associated with schizophrenia (p= 0.0338), and that the CATT(6) allele and CATT(6)-G haplotype were significantly associated with female adolescent-onset schizophrenia (AsOS) (corrected p = 0.0222 and p= 0.0147, respectively).
   Conclusions: These results suggest that serum MIF level is a potential pharmacodynamic and/or monitoring marker of schizophrenia, and is related to a novel antipsychotic effect beyond dopamine antagonism. Furthermore, the MIF gene polymorphisms are associated with the risk for schizophrenia especially in adolescent females, and are potential stratification markers of schizophrenia. Further studies of MIF are warranted to elucidate the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and the effects of antipsychotics.

AB  - Transplantation of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) has been shown to enhance synapse formation. However, the mechanisms underlying this effect are not completely understood. We performed profiling of the OEC and astrocyte secretomes via a proteomics approach, in case hevin secreted by astrocytes might be involved in the formation of synapses. Semi-quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that 25 proteins were highly expressed, and 22 were weakly expressed in OEC conditioned medium compared with astrocyte conditioned medium. These molecules are highly associated with neural differentiation and regeneration, enzyme regulatory activity, and growth factor binding. The quantification data of clusterin, fibronectin, hevin, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 and secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine were further confirmed by western blotting. Moreover, the addition of hevin in the culture medium improved neurite sprouting and outgrowth of differentiated neural stem cells. The greater expression of hevin in OEC conditioned medium than in astrocyte conditioned medium was associated with a greater capacity of synaptic formation. Thus, our results indicate that soluble factors secreted by OECs provide a permissive environment for nerve repair, and hevin is one of the key molecules facilitating neurite sprouting and outgrowth.

AB  - Background: Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the most serious cardiovascular diseases, characterized by a rapid and irreversible decline in myocardial function. Early detection of patients with MI and prolonging the optimal therapeutic window of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) are particularly important. This study aimed to identify the diagnostic biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets for acute myocardial infarction.Method: We generated the AMI mouse models by ligating the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Six time points-Sham, AMI 10-min, 1-h, 6-h, 24-h, and 72-h-were chosen to examine the molecular changes that occur during the AMI process. RNA-seq and DIA-MS were performed on the infarcted left ventricular tissues of AMI mice at each time point. Co-expression pattern genes were screened from myocardial infarction samples at different time points by time-series analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were used to examine these genes. Using the Interactive Gene/Protein Retrieval Tool (STRING) database, the protein-protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed and the hub genes were identified. In order to evaluate the diagnostic value of hub genes, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed. An independent data set, GSE163772, confirmed the diagnostic value of hub genes further.Result: We obtained the expression profiles at different time points after the occurrence of heart failure through high-throughput sequencing, and found 167 genes with similar expression patterns through time series analysis. The immune response and immune-related pathways had the greatest enrichment of these genes. Among them, Itgb2 Syk, Tlr4, Tlr2, Itgax, and Lcp2 may play key roles as hub genes. Combined with the results of proteomic analysis, it was found that the expression of Coro1a in both omics increased with time. The results of external validation showed that TLR2, ITGAX, and LCP2 had good predictive ability for AMI diagnosis.Conclusion: Itgb2, Syk, Tlr4, Tlr2, Itgax, Lcp2 and Coro1a are considered to be the seven key genes significantly associated with AMI. Our results may provide potential targets for the prevention of adverse ventricular remodeling and the treatment of AMI.

AB  - Nerve fibers of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) have a remarkable ability to regenerate up to an almost complete recovery of normal function following a crush or a Sunderland Type II injury. This process is governed by glial cells, known as Schwann cells, through their unique capacity to dedifferentiate into cells that drive the healing process. Despite that many progresses have occurred in restorative medicine and microsurgery, the regenerative process after a severe lesion of a major nerve trunk (e.g., Sunderland Types III-V) is often incomplete and functional recovery is unsatisfactory. In this aspect, it is known that glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) of the extracellular matrix are involved in proliferation, synaptogenesis, neural plasticity, and regeneration of the PNS. Here, we developed poly(caprolactone) (PCL) fibrous scaffolds functionalized with GAGs, which allowed us to assess their influence on the adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of Schwann cells. We found that both aligned and random fiber scaffolds functionalized with GAGs resulted in increased cell proliferation on day 1. In addition, aligned functionalized scaffolds also resulted in increased GAG presence on day 1, probably because of cell extracellular matrix (ECM) formation and an increased syndecan-4 expression on day 7. A different modification and activation of Schwann cells in the presence of GAG versus no-GAG scaffolds was underlined by proteomic comparative analysis, where a general downregulation of the expression of intracellular/structural and synthetic proteins was shown on day 7 for GAG-functionalized scaffolds with regard to the nonfunctionalized ones. In conclusion, we have shown that GAG-functionalized scaffolds are effective in modulating Schwann cell behavior in terms of adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation and should be considered in strategies to improve PNS repair.
   Statement of Significance
   Nerve fibers functional recovery following a severe trauma of the Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) still represents a huge challenge for neurosurgery nowadays. In this respect, tissue engineering is committed to develop new constructs able to guide Schwann cells by mimicking the natural extracellular matrix environment. To this purpose, we successfully fabricated polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds with two well-defined fiber deposition patterns, functionalized with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and assessed for their potential as support for Schwann cells adhesion, growth and differentiation, by both classical biochemistry and LC-MS-based proteomic profiling. By this way, we showed that PCL-GAGs scaffolds could represent a promising artificial substrate that closely mimics the recently established pattern of Schwann cells migration into the regenerating nerve and, therefore, it should be considered in strategies to improve PNS repair.

AB  - The environmental toxin S-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) has been proposed to contribute to neurodegenerative diseases. We have previously shown that neonatal exposure to BMAA results in dose-dependent cognitive impairments, proteomic alterations and progressive neurodegeneration in the hippocampus of adult rats. A high BMAA dose (460 mg/kg) also induced intracellular fibril formation, increased protein ubiquitination and enrichment of proteins important for lipid transport and metabolism. The aim of this study was therefore to elucidate the role of neuronal lipids in BMAA-induced neurodegeneration. By using matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI IMS), we characterized the spatial lipid profile in the hippocampus of six month-old rats that were treated neonatally (postnatal days 9-10) with 460 mg/kg BMAA. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed long-term changes in distinct ganglioside species (GM, GD, GT) in the dentate gyrus. These changes could be a consequence of direct effects on ganglioside biosynthesis through the b-series (GM3-GD3-GD2-GD1b-GT1b) and may be linked to astrogliosis. Complementary immunohistochemistry experiments towards GFAP and sloop further verified the role of increased astrocyte activity in BMAA-induced brain damage. This highlights the potential of imaging MS for probing chemical changes associated with neuropathological mechanisms in situ.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause ofmorbidity and disability, with a considerable socioeconomic burden. Heterogeneity of pathoanatomical subtypes and diversity in the pathogenesis and extent of injury contribute to differences in the course and outcome of TBI. Following the primary injury, extensive and lasting damage is sustained through a complex cascade of events referred to as "secondary injury.'' Neuroinflammation is proposed as an important manipulable aspect of secondary injury in animal and human studies. Because neuroinflammation can be detrimental or beneficial, before developing immunomodulatory therapies, it is necessary to better understand the timing and complexity of the immune responses that follow TBI. With a rapidly increasing body of literature, there is a need for a clear summary of TBI neuroimmunology. This review presents our current understanding of the immune response to TBI in a chronological and compartment-based manner, highlighting early changes in gene expression and initial signaling pathways that lead to activation of innate and adaptive immunity. Based on recent advances in our understanding of innate immune cell activation, we propose a new paradigm to study innate immune cells following TBI that moves away from the existing M1/M2 classification of activation states toward a stimulus- and disease-specific understanding of polarization state based on transcriptomic and proteomic profiling.

AB  - Reactive astrocytes in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) change their molecular expression pattern and release toxic factors that contribute to neurodegeneration and microglial activation. We and others identified a dysregulated inflammatory miRNA profile in ALS patients and in mice models suggesting that they represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Such cellular miRNAs are known to be released into the secretome and to be carried by small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), which may be harmful to recipient cells. Thus, ALS astrocyte secretome may disrupt cell homeostasis and impact on ALS pathogenesis. Previously, we identified a specific aberrant signature in the cortical brain of symptomatic SOD1-G93A (mSOD1) mice, as well as in astrocytes isolated from the same region of 7-day-old mSOD1 mice, with upregulated S100B/HMGB1/Cx43/vimentin and downregulated GFAP. The presence of downregulated miR-146a on both cases suggests that it can be a promising target for modulation in ALS. Here, we upregulated miR-146a with pre-miR-146a, and tested glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) and dipeptidyl vinyl sulfone (VS) for their immunoregulatory properties. VS was more effective in restoring astrocytic miR-146a, GFAP, S100B, HMGB1, Cx43, and vimentin levels than GUDCA, which only recovered Cx43 and vimentin mRNA. The miR-146a inhibitor generated typical ALS aberrancies in wild type astrocytes that were abolished by VS. Similarly, pre-miR-146a transfection into the mSOD1 astrocytes abrogated aberrant markers and intracellular Ca2+ overload. Such treatment counteracted miR-146a depletion in sEVs and led to secretome-mediated miR-146a enhancement in NSC-34-motor neurons (MNs) and N9-microglia. Secretome from mSOD1 astrocytes increased early/late apoptosis and FGFR3 mRNA in MNs and microglia, but not when derived from pre-miR-146a or VS-treated cells. These last strategies prevented the impairment of axonal transport and synaptic dynamics by the pathological secretome, while also averted microglia activation through either secretome, or their isolated sEVs. Proteomic analysis of the target cells indicated that pre-miR-146a regulates mitochondria and inflammation via paracrine signaling. We demonstrate that replenishment of miR-146a in mSOD1 cortical astrocytes with pre-miR-146a or by VS abrogates their phenotypic aberrancies and paracrine deleterious consequences to MNs and microglia. These results propose miR-146a as a new causal and emerging therapeutic target for astrocyte pathogenic processes in ALS.

AB  - Exosomes are nanometer-sized vesicles involved in intercellular communication, and they are released by various cell types. To learn about exosomes produced by Schwann cells (SCs) and to explore their potential function in repairing the central nervous system (CNS), we isolated exosomes from supernatants of SCs by ultracentrifugation, characterized them by electron microscopy and immunoblotting and determined their protein profile using proteomic analysis. The results demonstrated that Schwann cell-derived exosomes (SCDEs) were, on average, 106.5nm in diameter, round, and had cup-like concavity and expressed exosome markers CD9 and Alix but not tumor susceptibility gene (TSG) 101. We identified a total of 433 proteins, among which 398 proteins overlapped with the ExoCarta database. According to their specific functions, we identified 12 proteins that are closely related to CNS repair and classified them by different potential mechanisms, such as axon regeneration and inflammation inhibition. Gene Oncology analysis indicated that SCDEs are mainly involved in signal transduction and cell communication. Biological pathway analysis showed that pathways are mostly involved in exosome biogenesis, formation, uptake and axon regeneration. Among the pathways, the neurotrophin, PI3K-Akt and cAMP signaling pathways played important roles in CNS repair. Our study isolated SCDEs, unveiled their contents, presented potential neurorestorative proteins and pathways and provided a rich proteomics data resource that will be valuable for future studies of the functions of individual proteins in neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Limbic encephalitis with antibodies against adenylate kinase 5 (AK5) has been difficult to characterize because of its rarity.
   In this study, we identified 10 new cases and reviewed 16 previously reported patients, investigating clinical features, IgG subclasses, human leucocyte antigen and CSF proteomic profiles.
   Patients with anti-AK5 limbic encephalitis were mostly male (20/26, 76.9%) with a median age of 66 years (range 48-94). The predominant symptom was severe episodic amnesia in all patients, and this was frequently associated with depression (17/25, 68.0%). Weight loss, asthenia and anorexia were also highly characteristic, being present in 11/25 (44.0%) patients. Although epilepsy was always lacking at disease onset, seizures developed later in a subset of patients (4/25, 16.0%). All patients presented CSF abnormalities, such as pleocytosis (18/25, 72.0%), oligoclonal bands (18/25, 72.0%) and increased Tau (11/14, 78.6%). Temporal lobe hyperintensities were almost always present at disease onset (23/26, 88.5%), evolving nearly invariably towards severe atrophy in subsequent MRIs (17/19, 89.5%). This finding was in line with a poor response to immunotherapy, with only 5/25 (20.0%) patients responding. IgG1 was the predominant subclass, being the most frequently detected and the one with the highest titres in nine CSF-serum paired samples. A temporal biopsy from one of our new cases showed massive lymphocytic infiltrates dominated by both CD4+ and CT8 + T cells, intense granzyme B expression and abundant macrophages/microglia. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) analysis in 11 patients showed a striking association with HLA-B*08:01 [7/11, 63.6%; odds ratio (OR) = 13.4, 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.8-47.4], C*07:01 (8/11, 72.7%; OR = 11.0, 95% CI: 2.9-42.5), DRB1*03:01 (8/11, 72.7%; OR = 14.4, 95% CI: 3.7-55.7), DQB1*02:01 (8/11, 72.7%; OR = 13.5, 95% CI: 3.5-52.0) and DQA1*05:01 (8/11, 72.7%; OR = 14.4, 95% CI: 3.7-55.7) alleles, which formed the extended haplotype B8-C7-DR3-DQ2 in 6/11 (54.5%) patients (OR = 16.5, 95% CI: 4.8-57.1). Finally, we compared the CSF proteomic profile of five anti-AK5 patients with that of 40 control subjects and 10 cases with other more common non-paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis (five with antibodies against leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 and five against contactin-associated protein-like 2), as well as 10 cases with paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (five with antibodies against Yo and five against Ma2). These comparisons revealed 31 and seven significantly upregulated proteins in anti-AK5 limbic encephalitis, respectively mapping to apoptosis pathways and innate/adaptive immune responses. These findings suggest that the clinical manifestations of anti-AK5 limbic encephalitis result from a distinct T cell-mediated pathogenesis, with major cytotoxicity-induced apoptosis leading to a prompt and aggressive neuronal loss, likely explaining the poor prognosis and response to immunotherapy.

AB  - Brain in vitro models are critically important to developing our understanding of basic nervous system cellular physiology, potential neurotoxic effects of chemicals, and specific cellular mechanisms of many disease states. In this study, we sought to address key shortcomings of current brain in vitro models: the scarcity of comparative data for cells originating from distinct brain regions and the lack of multiregional brain in vitro models. We demonstrated that rat neurons from different brain regions exhibit unique profiles regarding their cell composition, protein expression, metabolism, and electrical activity in vitro. In vivo, the brain is unique in its structural and functional organization, and the interactions and communication between different brain areas are essential components of proper brain function. This fact and the observation that neurons from different areas of the brain exhibit unique behaviors in vitro underline the importance of establishing multiregional brain in vitro models. Therefore, we here developed a multiregional brain-on-a-chip and observed a reduction of overall firing activity, as well as altered amounts of astrocytes and specific neuronal cell types compared with separately cultured neurons. Furthermore, this multiregional model was used to study the effects of phencyclidine, a drug known to induce schizophrenia-like symptoms in vivo, on individual brain areas separately while monitoring downstream effects on interconnected regions. Overall, this work provides a comparison of cells from different brain regions in vitro and introduces a multiregional brain-on-a-chip that enables the development of unique disease models incorporating essential in vivo features.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Due to the scarcity of comparative data for cells from different brain regions in vitro, we demonstrated that neurons isolated from distinct brain areas exhibit unique behaviors in vitro. Moreover, in vivo proper brain function is dependent on the connection and communication of several brain regions, underlining the importance of developing multiregional brain in vitro models. We introduced a novel brain-on-a-chip model, implementing essential in vivo features, such as different brain areas and their functional connections.
